CTD DATA
--------
* SeaBird CTD 704 was used for the whole cruise.

* CTD data are in text files named *.all, containing 2-dbar data.
An example of file naming convention:

a07034020.all -  a = Aurora Australis
                07 = year of first CTD
                03 = cruise number
                 4 = CTD instrument number
               020 = CTD cast number

* Post-processed bathymetry data for the cruise are not available, and
all bottom depth values in the file headers are approximate only.

* The CTD 2 dbar files consist of a 15 line header with station info,
followed by the data in column format, as follows:

column 1 - pressure (dbar) 
column 2 - temperature (degrees C, T90 scale) 
column 3 - conductivity (mS/cm) 
column 4 - salinity (PSS78) 
column 5 - dissolved oxygen (umol/l) 
column 6 - fluorescence (manufacturer supplied calibration giving
           units ug/l)
column 7 - photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (uncalibrated 
           voltage data)
column 8 - transmittance (manufacturer supplied calibration, dimensionless)
column 9 - transmittance "spikiness" (dimensionless)
column 10 - no. of data points used in the 2 dbar bin
column 11 - fluorescence, upcast data
column 12 - PAR, upcast data
column 13 - transmittance, upcast data
column 14 - transmittance "spikiness", upcast data
column 15 - no. of data points used in the 2 dbar bin, upcast data

* CTD temperature, conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen and PAR
are all 2 dbar averaged values, for each even valued pressure bin.

* Fluorescence data are the minimum value within each 2 dbar bin.
Both downcast and upcast data are supplied for fluorescence, PAR and
transmittance.

* Transmittance data in columns 8 and 13 are the maximum value within each 2 dbar bin.
Transmittance "spikiness" data in columns 9 and 14 are the standard deviation of 
transmittance "spike size" within each 2 dbar bin, where "spike size" is the difference
of each 24 Hz transmittance reading from the 2 dbar transmittance maximum envelope (see data 
report for full definition of this parameter).

* columns 2 to 10 are downcast data; columns 11 to 15 are upcast data

* All files start at 2 dbar, and there is a line for each 2 dbar bin.
Any missing data are filled by the null value -9.0

* Temperature/conductivity/salinity data are from the primary temperature
and conductivity sensor pair for all CTD casts, except for CTD 8 and
30 (secondary sensor data used).

* Station information contained in the headers is described below in the
section on station data, with the addition of:
lastbin = deepest 2 dbar pressure bin (dbar) for the cast; and
pressure (dbar) at the minimum altimeter value

* Note that all oxygen values are volumetric (i.e. umol/l).

* Note that some deeper fluorescence data are slightly negative in value,
due to the calibration coefficients supplied.



BOTTLE DATA
-----------
* Note that all nutrient and oxygen values are volumetric (i.e. umol/l).

* The bottle data (hydrochemistry) are contained in the a0703.bot text file, with the
following columns:

column 1 - cast number
column 2 - ctd pressure (dbar)
column 3 - ctd temperature (deg. C, T90 scale)
column 4 - null data (i.e. -9.0)
column 5 - ctd conductivity (mS/cm)
column 6 - ctd salinity (PSS78)
column 7 - bottle salinity (PSS78)
column 8 - phosphate (umol/l) 
column 9 - nitrate (umol/l) (i.e. total nitrate+nitrite)
column 10 - silicate (umol/l)
column 11 - bottle dissolved oxygen (umol/l)
column 12 - bottle flag (1=good,0=suspicious,-1=bad, relevant to
            salinity values for CTD calibration i.e. not applicable to other bottle data)
column 13 - niskin bottle number
column 14 - ctd fluorescence (units as per CTD note above)
column 15 - ctd photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (units as per CTD note above)
column 16 - ctd transmittance (units as per CTD note above)
column 17 - ammonia (umol/l)
column 18 - nitrite (umol/l)

* Columns 2, 3, 5, 6, 14, 15 and 16 are all the averages of CTD upcast burst data 
(i.e. averages of the 10 seconds of CTD data prior to each bottle firing). Temperature,
conductivity and salinity data are from the primary sensor pair (except for CTD cast 8 and 30).

* Note that these burst averages of fluorescence and transmittance include all the data spikes
within each 10 second averaging period. For fluorescence minimum values, refer to upcast 2dbar 
values in the *.all files (similarly for transmittance maximum values).

* Any missing data are filled by the null value -9.0

* Please refer to the file sussnut.dat for suspicious nutrient values not deleted from the data.

* Note that ammonia and nitrite are low level values. Low level readings from
the Lachat autoanalyser, including low level near surface phosphate and nitrate+nitrite data, and
all ammonia and nitrite data, should be used with caution - the accuracy for these
low level readings is unknown.



STATION INFORMATION
-------------------
A summary of the station information is contained in the a0703.sta file
(this station information is also included in the matlab file a0703.mat).

are not available).



MATLAB FORMAT
-------------

* In the matlab files, column number for each array corresponds with CTD cast number.

* In the matlab files, NaN is a null value.

* In the matlab CTD file, profiles are padded down to 3000 dbar.
