---------------------------------

Here's the final CTD/bottle data for voyage au0404 ("HIPPIES"),
Aurora Australis Voyage 4, 6th Dec 2003 to 1st Mar 2004 
(V4 2003/2004).

Please delete any previous versions you have of the data, and replace with
these final versions.

All data are the property of the Australian Antarctic Division.
The principal investigators are Andrew Constable (Antarctic Division)
                                Esmee van Wijk (formerly Antarctic Division,
                                                now ACE CRC)
                                Guy Williams (ACE CRC)

CTD DATA
--------
* SeaBird CTD 703 was used for the entire cruise.

* CTD data are in text files named *.all, containing 2-dbar
averaged data. An example of file naming convention:

a04043020.all -  a = Aurora Australis
                04 = year
                04 = cruise number
                 3 = CTD instrument number
               020 = CTD station number


* The files consist of a 15 line header with station info,
followed by the data in column format, as follows:

column 1 - pressure (dbar)
column 2 - temperature (degrees C, T90 scale)
column 3 - conductivity (mS/cm)
column 4 - salinity (PSS78)
column 5 - dissolved oxygen (umol/l)
column 6 - fluorescence (manufacturer specifies units mg/m3, but safer
                         to assume uncalibrated units)
column 7 - no. of data points used in the 2 dbar bin


* All files start at 2 dbar, and there is a line for each 2 dbar value.
Any missing data are filled by the null value -9.0

* All CTD data are downcast data.

* Temperature/conductivity/salinity data are from the primary temperature
and conductivity sensor pair.

* There are no calibrated oxygen data for this cruise.




BOTTLE DATA
-----------
* The bottle data (hydrology) are contained in the a0404.bot text file, with the
following columns:

column 1 - station number
column 2 - ctd pressure (dbar)
column 3 - ctd temperature (deg. C, T90 scale)
column 4 - digital reversing thermometer temperature (deg. C)
column 5 - ctd conductivity (mS/cm)
column 6 - ctd salinity (PSS78)
column 7 - bottle salinity (PSS78)
column 8 - phosphate (umol/l)
column 9 - nitrate (umol/l) (i.e. total nitrate+nitrite)
column 10 - silicate (umol/l)
column 11 - bottle dissolved oxygen (umol/l)
column 12 - bottle flag (1=good,0=suspicious,-1=bad,mainly relevant
                     to bottle salinity values for CTD calibration, but not necessarily)
column 13 - niskin bottle number

* Columns 2, 3, 5 and 6 are all the averages of CTD upcast burst data (i.e. averages of the
10 seconds of CTD data prior to each bottle firing). Data from CTD primary temperature
and conductivity sensor pair.

* Any missing data are filled by the null value -9.0

* Nutrient samples were collected, but not analysed.

* Bottle oxygen samples were not collected on this cruise.

* There are no reversing thermometer data in the file.




STATION INFORMATION
-------------------
A summary of the station information is contained in the a0404.sta file
(this station information is also included in the matlab file a0404.mat).
All times are UTC. The data columns for each station are:

station
date (dd Mmm yyyy), start of downcast
time (hhmmss), start of downcast
latitude (degrees and decimal minutes), start of downcast
longitude (degrees and decimal minutes), start of downcast
water depth (m), start of downcast
time (hhmmss), bottom of cast
latitude (degrees and decimal minutes), bottom of cast
longitude (degrees and decimal minutes), bottom of cast
water depth (m), bottom of cast
time (hhmmss), end of cast
latitude (degrees and decimal minutes), end of cast
longitude (degrees and decimal minutes), end of cast
water depth (m), end of cast
altimeter (m) - minimum altimeter value
maximum pressure (dbar) for the cast
decimal time, start of downcast
decimal time, bottom of downcast
decimal time, end of downcast

* All times are UTC

* Decimal times are decimal days from 2400 on 31st Dec. 2002 (so, for example,
midday on 2nd January 2003 = decimal time 1.5).




MATLAB FORMAT
-------------
* In the matlab files, column number for each array corresponds with CTD station number.

* In the matlab files, NaN is a null value.

* In the bottle file, the rows 1 to 24 are the shallowest to deepest Niskins respectively.

* CTD data are in matlab format in the file a0404.mat, which includes station info.
The array names have the following meaning:
all times are UTC
"start" refers to start of cast
"bottom" refers to bottom of cast
"end" refers to end of cast
"decimal time" is decimal days from 2400 on 31st Dec. 2002 (so, for example,
midday on 2nd January 2003 = decimal time 1.5).
"lat" is latitude (decimal degrees, where -ve = south)
"lon" is longitude (decimal degrees, where +ve = east)
"time" is hhmmss time
"botd" is ocean depth (m)
maxp = maximum pressure of the CTD cast (dbar)
ctdunit = instrument serial number
"ctd" is the upcast CTD burst data, for the parameters:
   cond=conductivity (mS/cm)
   fluoro=fluorescence
   npts=number of data points used in the 2 dbar bin
   ox=dissolved oxygen (umol/l)
   press=pressure (dbar)
   sal=salinity (PSS78)
   temp=temperature (deg.C T90)
date is ddmmyyyy date
altimeter = minimum altimeter value (m)
press_alt = pressure (dbar) at the minimum altimeter value


* Bottle data are also in matlab format in the file called a0404bot.mat
The array names have the following meaning:
"ctd" refers to upcast CTD burst data, for the parameters:
   cond=conductivity (mS/cm)
   press=pressure (dbar) (also in array hyd_press)
   sal=salinity 9PSS78)
   temp=temperature (deg.C T90)
"hyd" refers to bottle data, for the parameters:
   ox=dissolved oxygen (umol/l)
   sal=salinity (PSS78)
flag = the bottle flagged described under the bottle data section
niskin = niskin bottle number
nitrate,phosphate,silicate = umol/l
station = station number
therm = digital reversing thermometer temperature



OTHER FILES/DATA AVAILABLE FOR THIS CRUISE
------------------------------------------
* The data report a0404doc.doc (MS WORD 2000 document), also available in the
pdf file a0404doc.pdf, contains important data quality information for the 
cruise, and describes the data calibration methodology.

* Ship's underway data (including bathymetry, sea surface parameters
and meteorological data) are available in the file hippies.ora (1 minute
averaged data), on request. 

* Ship's underway ADCP data are available for this cruise.
