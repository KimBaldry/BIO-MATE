! Quality codes (following CCHDO guidelines except flag 0):
!     0. No quality check performed on measurement.
!     1. Sample for this measurement was drawn from water bottle but analysis not received.
!     2. Acceptable measurement.
!     3. Questionable measurement.
!     4. Bad measurement.
!     5. Not reported.
!     6. Mean of replicate measurements (Number of replicates is specified in column bincount).
!     9. Sample not drawn for this measurement from this bottle.
!
! The POC and PON samples are acidified to get rid of inorganic carbon and nitrogen.
! A DOC/DON adsorption blank,to account for contamination and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
! and nitrogen (DON),was taken during sampling by stacking two filters in the filtration funnels and
! filtering the sample as normal. The upper filter will be the total (dissolved and particulate) organic
! carbon and nitrogen sample and the bottom filter will be the DOC/DON adsorption blank. The
! organic carbon and nitrogen from the DOC/DON adsorption blank was removed from the
! concentration of the total filters to retrieve particulate organic carbon (POC) and nitrogen (PON).
!
! Blank:
!     C = 23.36 micrograms
!     N = 3.38 micrograms
