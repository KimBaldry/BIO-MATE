Files in this set:

README.$CRUISE - this file

$CRUISE_HPLC.txt - HPLC pigments data

$CRUISE_apad.tar.bz2 - a zipped tarball with absorption scans of ap, ad
  includes files like $CRUISE_apad_NNNN.txt
  where NNNN = sequence number of the sample
  has the absorption the particulates (ap) and detritus (ad)
  for 300-750 nm with a step of 1 nm.

	ad: Kishino et al., 1985.

$CRUISE_ag.tar.bz2 - a zipped tarball with absorption scans of ag
  includes files like $CRUISE_ag_NNNN.txt
  where NNNN = sequence number of the sample
  has the absorption the Gelbstoff (ag)
  for 250-750 nm with a step of 1 nm.
  The methods are described in
  Mitchell et al. 2000. NASA/TM-2000-209966, p.125-153.
