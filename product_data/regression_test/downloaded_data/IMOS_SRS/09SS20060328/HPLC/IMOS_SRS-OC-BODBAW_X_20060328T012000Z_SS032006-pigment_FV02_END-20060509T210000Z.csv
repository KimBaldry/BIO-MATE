abstract,"The data were collected at a total of 7 stations and 29 underway locations on the RV Southern Surveyor cruise 03/2006. These samples were taken along the Great Australian Bite on a transit voyage from Hobart to Esperance. The data were collected to determine the bio-optical charateristics of this region. The data can be used for Ocean Colour sensor validation. Parameters measured are pigments, and the absorption coefficient for particulate (a/p) and detrital or non-algal (a/d) components of the water column.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
