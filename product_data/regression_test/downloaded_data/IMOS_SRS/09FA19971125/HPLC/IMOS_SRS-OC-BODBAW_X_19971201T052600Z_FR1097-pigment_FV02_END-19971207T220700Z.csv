abstract,"The data were collected at a total of 23 stations on the Franklin cruise 10/97. These samples were taken along the St Helens, Schouten Island, Tasman Island, Bruny Island, SE Cape, Pt Davey, Strahan, Marawah and King Island transects. The data were collected to determine the bio-optical charateristics of this region. The data can be used for Ocean Colour sensor validation. Parameters measured are the absorption coefficients of CDOM, phytoplankton and non-algal detrital matter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
