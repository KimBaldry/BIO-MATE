 <b>PI-Note:</b> To convert Beam C (C(1/m)) to Cp the following
                 amount was added to ALL casts:  -0.382

               In addition the following casts were adjusted:

	  98020502        -0.00300
	  98021001        -0.01800

 <b>AESOPS Investigators, Please note:</b>
  Begin and end parameters for time, latitude and longitude are
  provided in the core CTD and Bottle data.  Investigators
  submitting data related to CTD/Bottle casts are urged to use
  the single lat/lon entry from the Chief Scientist's event log.
