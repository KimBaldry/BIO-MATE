 <b>of:</b>              University of California, San Diego
 <b>dataset:</b>         Pigments, HPLC method, standard casts
 <b>project/cruise:</b>  AESOPS/RR_KIWI_6, APFZ Survey 1
 <b>ship:</b>            R/V Roger A. Revelle

 <b>Methodology:</b>
	Samples that had been frozen in liquid nitrogen were extracted as described
	previously (Goericke and Repeta, 1993, MEPS 101: 307 - 313).
	Pigment extracts were analyzed on the reverse phase HPLC system described
	below.   Pigments were detected by absorbance at 440nm.  The identity of
	pigments was confirmed by frequently checking on-line spectra against those
	of standards.
