Summary 

A hydrographic survey consisting of CTD/LADCP/rosette sections, bio-optical 
casts, trace metals CTD/rosette casts, underway shipboard ADCP, was carried out 
mainly along the 30E line in the southern Indian Ocean in February and March 
2008 (Fig. 1). The R/V Revelle departed Durban, South Africa on 4 February 2008.  
A total of 106 stations were occupied.  These included 106 LADCP/CTD/Rosette 
casts, 80 trace metal rosette casts, 66 bio-optical casts from 4 February to 16 
March. In addition, 17 ARGO were deployed. A couple dozen XBT drops were made 
for multibeam calibration and higher resolution sampling across fronts. Water 
samples (up to 36 10 liter containers) and CTD data were collected at each 
station. Aerosol samples were obtained throughout the cruise.

LADCP/CTD/rosette casts went to within 15-25 meters of the bottom, except in a 
few instances of rough topography or large waves where the closest approach was 
about 30m.  Water samples were collected and measured for salinity, dissolved 
oxygen, nutrients, total DIC, Total Alkalinity, CFCs, and samples were collected 
and stored for CDOM, DOC, Helium/Tritium, silicon and oxygen isotopes, black 
carbon, and C14 analyses on land. While underway, surface pCO2, temperature, 
conductivity, dissolved oxygen, fluorometry, meteorological, and acoustical 
bathymetric and sediment layer measurements were made.  The cruise ended in Cape 
Town, South Africa on 16 March 2008.

NARRATIVE 

CLIVAR I6S began 4 Feb 2008 on the R/V Roger Revelle, leaving Durban at dusk, 
heading south along the coast toward our first station, about a 25hr steam under 
typical conditions. The Agulhas Current pushed us with ADCP measured surface 
currents of more than 2 meters per second, giving us a speed over ground of more 
than 16 knots at times. We paused to carry out a test CTD station in approx. 
1200m water depth, pop all the rosette bottles, and rewind the Trace Metal cable 
on the SeaMac winch to prepare this system for work. We arrived on station 1 
Tuesday evening and began our section. The strong southwestward current and 2-3m 
opposing waves presented a challenge to the ship, but skillful maneuvering kept 
all operations going smoothly.

Soon we crossed the southern, returning, branch of the Agulhas Current which 
continues back to the Indian Ocean. The SST dropped to 18 C but surface salinity 
is still up above 35, indicating that we have not yet crossed the Subtropical 
Front. Once across, we were in the subpolar zone, with temperatures dropping 
again to near 10 C, and we began the trek across the Antarctic Circumpolar 
Current.

Before long, we encountered heavy weather and required several CTD wire re- 
terminations. These were accomplished rapidly with minimal time lost. At Station 
23, wind waves, and currents were such that we had to heave to for several hours 
to let the worst of it pass. Weather subsequently improved and all had needed 
rest. Total cruise time lost to weather was 48 hrs, not bad for a cruise of such 
length in this region.

Trace metals did not have their winch due to shipping problems, but their casts 
proceeded well with the onboard SeaMac winch, rebuilt by the excellent services 
of the Engineers onboard. Since the rebuilt winch cannot lift a full rosette 
system, the strategy was to alternate single and double casts to get the full 
depth profiles as originally set out in the cruise plan. This plan was followed 
up to Station 43. During the upcast at station 43 the rosette system was lost 
when its Kevlar cable parted (see Trace Metals summary below). From this point 
TM samples were obtained by the traditional method of Niskin bottles attached to 
the wire, with a messenger to trip the bottles.

The other component of the TM group was atmospheric aerosols. These were 
obtained from air pumped into the lab from a specially constructed tower forward 
of the working area of the ship. Initial reports are of barely detectable levels 
of dust in the atmosphere - an important measurement for iron fertilization and 
other bio-geo-chemical flux studies.

After these difficulties we had reasonable weather for nearly a week and gained 
some time lost in previous hard weather and seas. However, a series of hardware 
failures, beginning with the secondary temperature sensor, CTD pump, and rosette 
carousel cost us most of one day. A full-depth CTD cast and bottom water sample 
bottle was made before the carousel problem arose, but once onboard a new cable 
fixed that problem and a shorter, 1000m, water-sampling cast completed the 
station.

By this time in the cruise, chemistry is beginning to be fed into the onboard 
data-base. This enables all of us to plot various quantities, check data, and 
start to interpret results. The CTD watch has been identifying fronts, 
calculating transport and mixed-layer heat and salt budgets.

Eventually, we were able to enjoy the more peaceful weather south of 60 S, 
though winds did not remain weak for long. Air temperatures dropped to just 
below 0 C, and some ice started building up on deck. 

Notable pools of fresher cooler surface water were present from time-to-time 
according to the underway system and the CTD. We heard from colleagues on the 
German ice-breaker Polar Stern who also reported some of the freshest surface 
water observed in 10 years. The Polar Stern is at nearly the same latitude, but 
heading south along the Greenwich Meridian, then over to the German Antarctic 
Base.

On Feb 29 we modified the plan to account for a large storm with strong 
easterlies forecast to be south of 65 S. Thus we made a dog-leg east off 30 E 
toward the Gunnerus Ridge to avoid moving south so quickly. We then headed south 
along the ridge. The other point of this leg was to attempt twice to find the 
shallowest bathymetry outside the sea-ice edge and obtain observations on the 
shelf, across the Slope Current. Sea-ice images from NSIDC and FSU were helpful 
in preparing an approach plan.

In any case, winds built to 50 kt, with at least one gust to 70 kts . Seas 
peaked at 40 ft. But at about 1400 hrs a complete shift in winds and waves 
appeared with the winds dying down, and we put the CTD in the water. Our by now 
very experienced winch operators played a major role keeping tension down 
running the winch. CTD T failed on the way down, and the package was raised. We 
took advantage of this and the coming shallower depths to remove the outer ring 
of bottles and proceed with 18 bottles, lowering the package area and helping to 
prevent large wire tension swings. In this fashion we continued down the 
Gunnerus Ridge, an underwater butte with a fairly flat top at about 1200m depth, 
decreasing in depth mainly at the southern end near the ice edge.

Finally, we met the sea-ice edge as depth reached 350m. After this cast we went 
back north to spend the (short) night doing a yo-yo station to be able to 
estimate time variability in the stratification over a partial tidal cycle. This 
will at the very least help us to produce better error estimates for our 
transport calculations. During this period we did 17 yo-yo CTD casts during the 
night, over about 7 hour period, the last one collecting water. 

On the 5 March we awoke to a beautiful day. Sunrise produced a green "flash" 
lasting a whole second, with all on the bridge and the CTD watch on deck 
confirming the lasting color. As the sea-ice had cleared away during the night, 
we headed back south toward the Gunnerus Bank to look for shallower water. 
Enjoyed the beautiful weather and were able to follow an open path in broken 
sea-ice, stopping for TM and CTD casts. Finally, we reached the limit at Station 
92, depth 300m. 

We could see the Riiser-Larsen Peninsula in the distance to the SE like a giant 
white outcrop, moon-like, creviced and fissured in the early morning light. 
Later it was less well defined in the hazier light of the day. Very satisfying 
to see the continent, even a glacial part of it since I did not think we would 
ever be so lucky. Penguins also caught everyone's attention -at one point 
penguins were playing around the CTD as it was put in the water. Occasionally, 
whales were spotted. 

Soon we began the trek back starting with the 600m station on the slope, in 
cloudy skies and snowfall. By nighttime we were watching several icebergs drift 
near the 800m station. These can have a debris field around them of smaller 
bergs. It was slow going in case of growlers (smaller bits of ice) in our path. 
Very fine driving by the Mates and guidance from the Captain brought us onto 
station. Ship-ADCP and lowered ADCP both showed a strong (0.5 kt) SW flow along 
most of the southern end of the line, consistent with a Slope Current.

Near 64 S the multi-beam bathymetry showed a 300-400m deep canyon that might be 
the outer portion of the Ritcher Canyon. It was a very well-defined canal-shaped 
seafloor feature that crossed and then paralleled our track. At the penultimate 
station we deviated east 4nm in order to sample in the canyon but found nothing 
special apparent in the CTD or LADCP data at first look. Message was sent to N 
Ott of AWI's Southern Ocean bathymetry project asking for further info. On 8 
March we occupied our last station, #106. TM washed their bottles, then at about 
1100 we were underway until 1230 for the local noon optics cast. Watches were 
maintained for underway sampling.

On the way back there are two fronts we wanted to sample more intensively, the 
Polar Front (PF) and the Subtropical Front (STF). They are part of a system of 
fronts from about 40-50 S in this sector that are difficult to distinguish along 
one path. We can see the STF on satellite SST maps and it usually is a very 
strong narrow front, but we also see that it is not a straight line but a 
convoluted stream. The PF is not clear on SST but does have a signal on SSH. 
However, fronts often split, form eddies, or merge and their signals can be 
confused. Based on near-real-time AMSRE-E SST and satellite altimetry SSH data 
the students made their best estimate of frontal locations and decided upon a 
plan to sample this region with XBT drops. From these position estimates we 
slowed the ship to get better underway Doppler-current data across the frontal 
region.

Once in the frontal region beginning near 51 S we went into an enhanced 
chemistry sampling schedule, taking salt, nuts, O2, DIC, pH, Alk every hour 
instead of every 2 hr across the system. Slowing the ship with this pace 
automatically got us higher resolution. Near latitude 39 S, we finished all 
underway chemical sampling to pack and prepare for arrival. Some slowing of the 
ship took place to record better ADCP data on the remaining part of the transit 
to Cape Town, as we crossed the Agulhas Current system and entered the South 
Atlantic Ocean. We arrived at the pilot point 0300 16 March, one day early, and 
berthed a few hours later at Duncan Docks, Cape Town.

Summary


A hydrographic survey consisting of Rosette/CTD/LADCP sections, bio-optical
casts, trace metal CTD/rosette sections, underway shipboard ADCP and float
deployments was carried out mainly along the 30E line in the southern
Indian Ocean in February and March 2008.

The R/V Revelle departed Durban, South Africa on 4 February 2008.  A total
of 106 stations were occupied. 111 Rosette/CTD/LADCP casts, 28 Trace Metal
Rosette casts, 51 Trace Metal wire casts and 66 bio-optical casts were made
from 4 February to 16 March.  46 XBT drops were made for multibeam
calibration and higher resolution sampling across fronts; and 17 ARGO
floats were deployed.

Water samples (up to 36) and CTD data were collected at each
Rosette/CTD/LADCP station to within 15-30 meters of the bottom, dependent
upon bottom topography and sea state.  Salinity, dissolved oxygen and
nutrient samples were analyzed for up to 36 water samples from each cast of
the principal Rosette/CTD/LADCP program.  Water samples were also measured
on-board for DIC, Total Alkalinity, pH and CFCs.  Samples were collected
and stored for analysis ashore for CDOM, DOC/TDN, Helium/Tritium, C13/C14,
Oxygen isotopes, Silicon isotopes and Black Carbon.  Water samples for Al,
Fe and Mn were collected during trace metal CTD/rosette casts.

Underway surface measurements were made for pCO2, temperature,
conductivity, dissolved oxygen and fluorometry. Underway meteorological
data, and multibeam acoustical bathymetry and sediment layer data, were
also collected.  Aerosol samples were obtained throughout the cruise.  The
cruise ended in Cape Town, South Africa on 16 March 2008.


Introduction

A sea-going science team gathered from 9 oceanographic institutions
participated on the cruise.  Several other science programs were supported
with no dedicated cruise participant.  The science team and their
responsibilities are listed below.

Description of Measurement Techniques

1.  CTD/Hydrographic Measurements Program

The basic CTD/hydrographic measurements consisted of salinity, dissolved
oxygen and nutrient measurements made from water samples taken on
Rosette/CTD/LADCP casts, plus pressure, temperature, conductivity/salinity,
dissolved oxygen, transmissometer, fluorometer and photosynthetically
active radiation (PAR) from CTD profiles.  A total of 106 Rosette/CTD/LADCP
casts were made, usually to within 10-20m of the bottom.  The distribution
of samples is illustrated in figures 1.0 and 1.1.


Figure 1.0 Sample distribution, stations 1-52.
Figure 1.1 Sample distribution, stations 51-106.



1.1.  Water Sampling Package

Rosette/CTD/LADCP casts were performed with a package consisting of a
36-bottle rosette frame (SIO/STS), a 36-place carousel (SBE32) and 36 10L
Bullister bottles (SIO/STS).  Underwater electronic components consisted of
a Sea-Bird Electronics SBE9plus CTD (SIO/STS #777/#381 and U. of Hawaii
#725) with dual pumps, dual temperature (SBE3plus), dual conductivity
(SBE4C), dissolved oxygen (SBE43), transmissometer (Wetlabs), fluorometer
(Wetlabs CDOM), irradiance (Biospherical PAR), altimeter (Simrad) and LADCP
(RDI).




                                    -4-

The CTD was mounted vertically in an SBE CTD cage attached to the bottom of
the rosette frame and located to one side of the carousel.  The SBE4C
conductivity, SBE3plus temperature and SBE43 dissolved oxygen sensors and
their respective pumps and tubing were mounted vertically as recommended by
SBE.  Pump exhausts were attached to the sensor bracket on the side
opposite from the sensors and directed downward.  The transmissometer and
fluorometer were mounted horizontally along the bottom of the rosette
frame.  The PAR was mounted in a pipe that was hose-clamped to a vertical
post on the rosette; its sensor was about a foot above the upper crash
ring.  The altimeter was mounted on the inside of the bottom frame ring.
The RDI LADCP was mounted vertically on one side of the frame between the
bottles and the CTD. Its battery pack was located on the opposite side of
the frame, mounted on the bottom of the frame.

The rosette system was suspended from a UNOLS-standard three-conductor
0.322" electro-mechanical sea cable.  The R/V Revelle's aft Markey DESH-5
winch, with newer wire, was used through station 12.  The R/V Revelle's
forward Markey DESH-5 winch, with older, rusty wire, was used for the
remainder of the casts.

New slip rings were installed on the aft winch before station 1.  The aft
winch-to-lab deck cable induced electrical noise in the CTD signal, so it
was bypassed.  A cable extension was rigged from the aft winch J-box slip
ring output to the forward winch J-Box slip-ring input, thereafter using
the forward-J-Box-to-lab connection.

The sea cable was reterminated at the beginning of I06S, and multiple times
during the cruise.  Reterminations were performed at the rosette end
because of a kinked wire (after stations 11/1, 12/4, 21/3) and/or a broken
electrical termination (after station 12/1 at rosette, 12/4 at rosette and
slip ring, 15/2 at slip ring and 81/1 at rosette).  A mechanical
retermination was done before station 47/1, after observing 7 tight cork-
screw twists in the wire between the rosette and the block following a wave
in the rosette hangar.

The deck watch prepared the rosette 10-30 minutes prior to each cast.  The
bottles were cocked and all valves, vents and lanyards were checked for
proper orientation.  Once stopped on station, the rosette was moved out
from the aft hanger to the deployment location under the squirt boom block
using an air-powered cart and tracks.  The CTD was powered-up and the data
acquisition system in the computer lab started when directed by the deck
watch leader. The rosette was unstrapped from its tiedown location on the
cart.  Tag lines were threaded through the rosette frame and syringes were
removed from the CTD intake ports.  The winch operator was directed by the
deck watch leader to raise the package, the squirt boom and rosette were
extended outboard and the package quickly lowered into the water. The tag
lines were removed and the package was lowered to 10 meters, by which time
the sensor pumps had turned on. The winch operator was then directed to
bring the package back to the surface (0m. winch wireout) and to begin the
descent.

Each rosette cast was lowered to within 15-30 meters of the bottom, using
the altimeter, winch wireout, CTD depth and echosounder depth to determine
the distance.  Early in the cruise, three casts were unintentionally
lowered to less than 2 meters off the bottom (stations 2/3, 6/1 and 7/1).
There was no apparent damage to instrumentation; however, mud was still on
the CTD after station 6/1 recovery.

During the upcast the winch operator was directed to stop the winch at each
bottle trip depth. The CTD console operator waited 30 seconds before
tripping a bottle to insure the package wake had dissipated and the bottles
were flushed, then an additional 10 seconds after each bottle closure to
insure that stable CTD comparison data had been acquired.  Due to
weather/sea-state issues, bottles on some casts were tripped on the fly
(without stopping/soaking/flushing). During some later casts, the winch was
slowed to 10-20mpm at trip time for these on the fly trips.  On the fly
bottles are noted in Appendix D (Bottle Quality Comments).  Once the next-
to-last bottle had been closed, the deck watch leader directed the package
to the surface for the last bottle trip.

Standard sampling depths were used throughout CLIVAR I06S.  These standard
depths were staggered every station using 3 alternating sampling schemes.






                                    -5-

Recovering the package at the end of the deployment was essentially the
reverse of launching, with the additional use of poles and snap-hooks to
attach tag lines.  The rosette was secured on the cart and moved into the
aft hanger for sampling.  The bottles and rosette were examined before
samples were taken, and anything unusual was noted on the sample log.

Each bottle on the rosette had a unique serial number. This bottle
identification was maintained independently of the bottle position on the
rosette, which was used for sample identification.  Various parts of
bottles were occasionally changed or repaired.  The same bottles 1-36 were
used throughout the cruise.

Routine CTD maintenance included soaking the conductivity and DO sensors in
fresh water between casts to maintain sensor stability and occasionally
putting dilute Triton-X solution through the conductivity sensors to
eliminate any accumulating biofilms.  Sensors and pump tubes were rinsed
and drained between casts starting mid-way through the cruise, when air
temperature dropped to 3 deg.C, to prevent issues with water freezing in
and damaging sensors and pump tubes in higher latitudes.  Rosette
maintenance was performed on a regular basis. O-rings were changed and
lanyards repaired as necessary. Bottle maintenance was performed each day
to insure proper closure and sealing.  Valves were inspected for leaks and
repaired or replaced as needed.


1.2.  Underwater Electronics Packages

The SBE9plus CTDs were connected to an SBE32 carousel, providing for
single-conductor sea cable operation.  Within the 0.322 sea cable, two
conducting wires were soldered together as positive and the third
conducting wire was used as negative.  The sea cable armor was not used for
ground (return).  Power to the CTDs and sensors, carousels and altimeters
was provided through the sea cable from the SBE11plus deck unit in the main
lab.

CTD data were collected with a Sea-Bird Electronics SBE9plus CTD.  The CTDs
supplied a standard SBE-format data stream at a data rate of 24 Hz.  These
instruments provided pressure, dual temperature (SBE3plus), dual
conductivity (SBE4), dissolved oxygen (SBE43), PAR (Biospherical QCP)  and
altimeter (Benthos or Simrad 807) channels.  The 36-place systems also
provided fluorometer (Wetlabs CDOM) and transmissometer (Wetlabs CStar)
channels.  In addition, Surface PAR and GPS data were added to the data
stream via the SBE11plus deck unit.

Each CTD was outfitted with dual pumps. Primary temperature, conductivity
and dissolved oxygen were plumbed into one pump circuit and secondary
temperature and conductivity into the other. Dissolved oxygen was plumbed
into the secondary pump circuit for stations 1-3 and 79-80 only.  The
sensors were deployed vertically.

1.3.  Navigation and Bathymetry Data Acquisition

Navigation data were acquired from the ship's GP90 GPS receiver beginning
February 4 at 0000 UTC.  The data were noisy and irregular, apparently
because the GPS was transmitting at 2 Hz rather than the standard 1 Hz;
this output too much data for serial transmission at 4800 baud.  Raw GP90
ASCII NMEA strings output from the GPS receiver and stored by the ship's
computers were used to convert and store data in an ODF-style Navigation
file after the last station.

During final data checking ashore (early November 2008), unusual spacing
was noted between stations 74/75 on the station track.  The chief scientist
had also noted a problem with similar positions for stations 92/93.  A
close inspection of the navigation data indicated numerous problems around
stations 75 and 93, and probably elsewhere.  Bogus timestamps with Julian
date 2008072 were alternating with the correct date 2008060 near station
75; the wrong-date times/positions duplicated the valid data, but all the
bad records had a course/speed of -9/-9.  Using this course/speed pattern
and a simple Linux command (grep -v), more than 57.5k records with
course/speed of -9/-9 were eliminated from the navigation data.

There were also multiple duplicate date-/time-stamped levels in the
Navigation data, as well as single skipped seconds nearby.  The positions
were essentially identical, with slight differences in course/speed.  It
was assumed these were artifacts of the faster-than-1 Hz data coming in
from the GPS, and these data were left in place.




                                    -8-

The remaining data were screened to check for timegaps greater than 5
minutes (300 seconds).  Two more bogus Julian "2008072" levels were found
and omitted, and two rather large "real" gaps in the data were also found.
One gap was after station work had been completed, the other began just
before station 5 until just after the start of station 7.  In order to fill
this gap to get correct timestamps for stations 5 through 7, NMEA
times/positions were extracted from raw CTD data files for those stations
and merged with the ship's filtered GP90 data.

Station/cast time/position data were re-extracted from the fixed Navigation
data and updated into the ODF database for ALL casts, since this problem
could have affected any cast.  CTD and bottle data files were re-generated
for CCHDO after the position updates.  There were only a few differences in
the new i06s.sum file: only positions for stations 5-7, 75, and 92 changed
(the casts already noted above); any others changed by less than a few
hundredths of a minute.

Bathymetric data were logged from the Ship's Simrad EM120 multibeam
echosounder system, and were corrected using sound velocity profiles
derived from XBT data.  Depths were never merged with the ODF navigation
time series, but were logged at the CTD Console real-time. These depths
were later hand-entered into files and updated into the ODF database to be
reported with other cast metadata.

1.4.  CTD Data Acquisition and Rosette Operation

The primary CTD data acquisition system consisted of a networked generic PC
workstation running Windows XP-SP2, with an IEEE-488 connection to an
SBE-11plus (V2) deck unit.

Data for stations 1/2, 2/1, 4-13, and 16 were acquired using Seasave V7.14c
(ascii-hex format).  Stations 2/3 and 3/2 were acquired using Seasave Win32
V5.37d (binary format), after an attempt to utilize ODF's acquisition
system apparently disabled the Seasave ascii-hex acquisition system.
Stations 17-106 were acquired using Seasave V7.16a (ascii-hex format),
which was uploaded from Sea-Bird's website in an attempt to remedy bottle
16 trip-confirmation problems.

Stations 14 and 15 were acquired using SIO/ODF's acquisition system
(v.5.1.0-3.sts.el5).  This CTD data acquisition system consisted of three
networked generic PC workstations running CentOS-5.2 Linux (kernel
2.6.18-53.1.4.el5).  These workstations were configured with color graphics
displays, keyboards, trackballs and DVD+RW drives.  One Linux system had 8
additional RS-232 ports via a Comtrol Rocketport PCI serial controller, and
was connected to the SBE-11plus (V2) deck unit via RS-232. This workstation
was designated the CTD console, and provided an interface and operational
displays for controlling and monitoring a CTD deployment and closing
bottles on the rosette. Another of the Linux workstations was designated as
the website and database server and maintained the hydrographic database
for I06S. All three systems were used to maintain redundant backups of the
data.

The SIO/ODF systems were interconnected through a 1000BaseTX ethernet
switch which was also connected to the ship's network. These systems were
available for real-time operational and CTD data displays, and provided for
CTD and hydrographic data management and backup.  Configuration problems
plagued the Linux acquisition software, which was finally abandoned after a
failed cast start-up at station 16.  Seasave-acquired data were uploaded to
the Linux systems after acquisition for each cast, then the Linux systems
were used for post-cast CTD data processing.

CTD deployments were initiated by the console watch after the ship had
stopped on station.  The watch maintained a CTD Cast log containing a
description of each deployment, a record of every attempt to close a bottle
and any pertinent comments.

Once the deck watch had deployed the rosette, the winch operator would
lower it to 10 meters.  The SIO/ODF CTD sensor pumps were configured with a
5-second pump startup delay (vs. the Sea-Bird standard 60-second delay),
and were usually on by this time. The console operator checked the CTD data
for proper sensor operation, waited an additional 60 seconds for sensors to
stabilize, then instructed the winch operator to bring the package to the
surface, pause for 10 seconds, and descend to a target depth (wire-out).
The profiling rate was no more than 30m/min to 50m, no more than 45m/min to




                                    -9-

200m and no more than 60m/min deeper than 200m depending on sea cable
tension and the sea state.

The console watch monitored the progress of the deployment and quality of
the CTD data through interactive graphics and operational displays.
Additionally, the watch created a sample log for the deployment which would
be later used to record the correspondence between rosette bottles and
analytical samples taken.  The altimeter channel, CTD pressure, wire-out,
pinger and bathymetric depth were all monitored to determine the distance
of the package from the bottom, usually allowing a safe approach to within
10-20 meters.

Bottles were closed on the upcast by operating an on-screen control, and
were optimally tripped at least 30 seconds after stopping at the trip
location to allow the rosette wake to dissipate and the bottles to flush.
The winch operator was instructed to proceed to the next bottle stop at
least 10 seconds (ideally) after closing bottles to insure that stable CTD
data were associated with the trip.

Bottles were purposely tripped on the fly, particularly in the top 300-800m
of some casts, to prevent wire damage when wire tension and/or sea state
warranted.  Bottles from 2250m to the surface were tripped on the fly for
station 47; all bottles were tripped on the fly for stations 81/3 through
85.  All bottles tripped without stopping are indicated in Appendix D.

After the last bottle was closed, the console operator directed the deck
watch to bring the rosette on deck.  Once out of the water, the console
operator terminated the data acquisition, turned off the deck unit and
assisted with rosette sampling.

1.5.  CTD Data Processing

Shipboard CTD data processing was performed automatically at the end of
each deployment using SIO/ODF CTD processing software v.5.1.0-3.sts.el5.
Only stations 14 and 15 were acquired using SIO/ODF's acquisition system.
During SIO/ODF acquisition, CTD data were processed to a 0.5-second time
series realtime, and the raw data were backed up to another Linux
workstation every 10 seconds.  Raw CTD data and bottle trips acquired by
SBE Seasave on the Windows XP-SP2 workstation were copied onto the Linux
database and web server system after acquisition, then processed into a
0.5-second time series.

Raw CTD data were converted to engineering units, filtered, response-
corrected, calibrated and decimated to a more manageable 0.5-second time-
series (real-time for the ODF-acquired casts, post-cast for Seasave-
acquired casts). Laboratory calibrations for pressure, temperature and
conductivity were also applied.  Both the raw 24 Hz data and the 0.5-second
time-series were stored for subsequent processing, and a 2-decibar down-
cast pressure series was created.  CTD data at bottle trips were extracted
from the 0.5-second time-series data and used for CTD pressure, temperature
and salinity associated with each rosette bottle.  CTD oxygen data
extracted from the 2-decibar pressure series data were also stored in the
bottle database after fitting/correction.

All CTD data were reprocessed ashore (SIO/ODF software v. 5.1.1-1.sts.el5),
after carefully checking configuration files to verify sensor serial
numbers and calibrations for each cast, and to confirm which bytes in the
CTD data stream were assigned to each sensor.

Theta-Salinity and theta-O2 comparisons were made between down and upcasts
as well as between groups of adjacent deployments.  Vertical sections of
measured and derived properties from sensor data were checked for
consistency.

Rosette CTD data were examined for sensor problems, calibration shifts and
deployment or operational problems. The primary and secondary temperature
sensors (SBE3plus) were compared to each other and to the SBE35 temperature
sensor.  CTD conductivity sensors (SBE4C) were compared to each other, then
calibrated by examining differences between CTD and check-sample
conductivity values.  The CTD dissolved oxygen sensor data were calibrated
to check-sample data.  Additional theta-Salinity and theta-O2 comparisons
were made between down and upcasts as well as with adjacent deployments.
Vertical sections were made of the various properties derived from sensor
data and checked for consistency.




                                    -10-

There were numerous problems during I06S with CTDs, sensors and related
equipment, particularly during the first 18 stations and stations 69-81.

Signal noise started at 660db downcast on stations 2/1, and continued
through 3/2; a short in the primary pump was discovered, and the pump was
replaced after station 3.  Station 2 was re-occupied and the cast repeated,
but only to 376 db (2/1 max. pressure was 950 db).  Secondary temperature
began failing during station 2/3 and continued to fail near-surface until
it was replaced prior to station 6.

Salinity/CTDO signal noise plagued stations 6-18: severe noise in all
pumped sensors started abruptly 400-550db each downcast. The noise improved
somewhat around 1000-1500db, where signals still "jittered" the rest of
each downcast. Secondary signals were somewhat better (although still
noisy) for stations 6-10 downcasts, primary data were better stations 11-18
downcasts. Upcasts were significantly worse than downcasts, then signal
noise stopped just as abruptly between 275-190db each upcast. Attempts to
resolve the noise problems included: hitting the package on the bottom,
cutting kinked wire off and/or reterminating the wire at the rosette end
multiple times, switching to back-up winch/older wire, reterminating slip
rings at the winch end, replacing a pump and the CTDO sensor, and (Eureka!)
replacing the cable between pumps and CTD.

There were problems getting trip confirmations for carousel position 16
(niskin 16) beginning station 11, whenever carousel S/N SBE32-0187 was used
in combination with Seasave software (two different versions).  SBE35
reference temperature data were not uploaded routinely until station 19
onward, at which point the stored SBE35 timestamps could be synced with
Seasave trip times to get an accurate trip time.  This trip time was then
used to extract CTD trip data for bottle 16.  For the few casts where no
SBE35 data were available, CTD data with the best match to bottle salinity
(approximately 30-40 seconds after the bottle stop that corresponded to the
whole-minute console log trip-time) were selected for CTD trip data.  Trip
position 16 failed to confirm on stations 11-13, 16-37, 73-78, 81/3, 102
and 104-106.  Other casts were either acquired by ODF software (14-15), did
not need/avoided using bottle 16 (4-10, 38, 72, 79-80, 91, 93-101, 103),
triggered bottle 16 from carousel position 17 (82-90, 92), or used a
different carousel (39-71).

CTD #777 was on the main rosette through station 71. Secondary temperature
failed during most of stations 70 and 71.  Pumps failed to turn on during
the first two cast attempts at station 72; CTD #777 was then replaced by
CTD #381, and the secondary temperature sensor was also replaced.  No
bottle trips would confirm during the third cast, and the carousel was
traded out at some point during station 72.  A new cable fixed the tripping
problem for the final cast of station 72.

CTD #381 was used for stations 72-81. Signal noise problems started during
station 74, where CTDO and primary salinity offset simultaneously for two
short segments on the downcast.  The magnitude and duration of the
offset/noisy segments increased with each cast, with impact on secondary
salinity starting on station 75. The primary pump was changed out before
station 78, CTDO was switched to the secondary pump circuit prior to
station 79, and primary/secondary sensor pairs were input to their
counterparts' endcap connectors (without physically relocating any sensors)
before station 80, in a last attempt to diagnose/fix the problem.  CTD #381
was removed after station 80; inspection showed one pin was entirely
corroded away on an unused sensor plug-in, under a dummy plug, causing
water to leak into the CTD casing.

U. of Hawaii's spare CTD #725 was borrowed and used for the main rosette
for the rest of the cruise.  The first cast, station 81/1, had only U. of
Hawaii's primary sensors attached, but the primary temperature signal
failed at 1000db downcast through most of the upcast.  The wire was
reterminated, a cable to the primary temperature sensor was replaced, and
the previous secondary sensors and pump were added to the package before
station 81/3.

Near-surface data were missing from downcasts for 8 of 10 casts through
station 90 because there was no yoyo back to the surface after sensors
stabilized (due to weather conditions), combined with the standard SBE
60-second pump-on delay in the U. of Hawaii CTD.  Missing surface data were
extrapolated from deeper data, and the result compared to upcast data to
ensure nothing was distorted.  Cold conditions caused water to freeze/stick




                                    -11-

in pump tubes at the start of at least 3 casts (stations 88, 97 and 98).
Freezing/sensor instability was noticed by alert console operators, and
lowering the CTD was delayed until after the pump tubes had cleared,
sensors were stable, and the CTD was returned to near-surface.

A few more noisy signal problems reared their ugly heads during stations
101 and 102 for sensors in both pump circuits.  Connections were
checked/re-seated before station 103, and signs of corrosion on pins were
noted.  An engine room problem caused a 20-minute winch failure/delay on
station 105, and there were a few more noisy data segments on the upcasts
of stations 105 and 106, the last I06S rosette casts.

The primary temperature and conductivity sensors (T1C1) were used for all
reported CTD data, with the exception of stations 6-9, 72-80 and 84.
Secondary sensor (T2C2) data were reported instead for these casts because
of problems with noisier data and/or offsets in the primary sensor data.
In addition, secondary (T2C2) data were used for CTD data associated with
bottle trips for the above casts, as well as stations 10-18 and 53, because
of problems with primary sensor data during upcasts.

Downcast CTD pressure-series data were reported for all casts unless sensor
fouling or noise problems warranted using upcast data instead.  Upcast CTD
pressure-series data were used for stations 56 and 74-76 only.

1.6.  CTD Sensor Laboratory Calibrations

Laboratory calibrations of the CTD pressure, temperature, conductivity and
dissolved oxygen sensors were performed prior to CLIVAR I06S.  SIO/STS
sensors were also calibrated within 5 months after the cruise.  The
calibration dates are listed in table 1.6.0.

1.7.  CTD Calibration Procedures

Three different CTDs were used during CLIVAR I06S: STS/ODF #777 (stations
1-71), STS/ODF #381 (stations 72-80) and U. of Hawaii #725 (stations
81-106).  All CTD instruments, and Temperature, Conductivity and Dissolved
Oxygen sensors were manufactured by SBE. The same STS/ODF sensors were used
for primary TC on stations 1-80, and a single pair of U. of Hawaii sensors
were used for primary TC on stations 81-106.  Three different secondary T
sensors were used for stations 1-5, 6-71 and 72-106; the same secondary C
sensor was used throughout the cruise.  An SBE35RT Digital Reversing
Thermometer served as an independent calibration check for T1 and T2
beginning station 19.  In-situ salinity and dissolved O2 check samples
collected during each cast were used to correct the conductivity and
dissolved O2 sensors.





                                    -12-

1.7.1.  CTD Pressure

The two STS/ODF Paroscientific Digiquartz pressure transducers (S/N 88907,
mounted on CTD#777 and S/N 58952, mounted on CTD#381) were calibrated in
June 2007 at the SIO/STS Calibration Facility.  The U. of Hawaii pressure
transducer (S/N 90560, mounted on CTD#725) was also calibrated in June 2007
at Sea-Bird Electronics (SBE).  Calibration coefficients derived from the
calibration were applied to raw pressures during each cast.  Residual
pressure offsets (the differences between the last pressure before
submerging at the start of cast, and the first pressure after emerging from
the water at the end of the cast) and CTD pressure readings on-deck were
monitored to check for calibration shifts.

The residual offsets were 0 to 0.6 db for CTD #777, 0.2 to 0.4 db for CTD
#381, and -0.85 to -0.5 db for CTD #725.  +0.7 db was added to the CTD #725
pressure calibration offset term, then raw data for stations 81-106 were
re-processed.  Final residual pressure offsets for all I06S casts ranged
from 0 to 0.6 db at both cast start and cast end.  No additional
adjustments were made to the calculated pressures.

1.7.2.  CTD Temperature

Several SBE3plus temperature sensors were used during the cruise.  Primary
temperature sensor (T1 = S/N 03P-4924) was used for stations 1-80; when the
entire package was changed to U. of Hawaii's CTD #725, their (T1 = S/N
03P-4297) was used as primary for stations 81-106.  Secondary temperature
sensor (T2 = S/N 03P-2495) served for stations 1-5, and was changed due to
sensor failure.  (T2 = S/N 03P-2322) was used on stations 6-71, also
changed out due to failure during stations 70 and 71.  (T2 = S/N 03P-4486)
was used on stations 72-106, with the exception of station 81/1, where a
secondary temperature sensor was not installed.

The SBE35RT Digital Reversing Thermometer is an internally-recording
temperature sensor that operates independently of the CTD. It is triggered
by the SBE32 carousel in response to a bottle closure. According to the
manufacturer's specifications, the typical stability is 0.001 deg.C per
year.  The SBE35RT on I06S (S/N 3528706-0034) was set to internally average
over approximately one ship roll period (8 seconds). It was located
equidistant between T1 and T2, with the sensing element aligned in a plane
with the T1 and T2 sensing elements.

Calibration coefficients derived from the pre-cruise calibrations were
applied to raw primary and secondary temperatures during each cast.  Two
independent metrics of calibration accuracy were examined.  The primary and
secondary temperatures were compared at each bottle closure, and the
SBE35RT temperatures were compared to primary and secondary temperatures at
each bottle closure.

The primary temperature sensor for stations 1-80, (T1 = S/N 03P-4924) was
corrected using [T1-SBE35RT] vs. Pressure for pressures greater than
1000db, to avoid most bottles fired on the fly. To exclude generally noisy
stations, only stations {1,2/3,4,5,19-76} were used to calculate the
correction coefficients that were applied to T1 for all stations 1-80. The
resulting first-order slope and offset as a function of pressure can be
found in Appendix A.  Corrections were not necessary for the primary
temperature sensor (T1 = S/N 03P-4297) used on stations 81-106.

For stations 1-5, secondary temperature sensor (T2 = S/N 03P-2495) required
a simple offset when compared to the SBE35RT temperature.

For stations 6-71, secondary temperature sensor (T2 = S/N 03P-2322)
required a second-order correction with respect to pressure when compared
to the primary ([T1-T2] vs. Pressure). A similar correction was observed
when using [T2-SBE35RT], but [T1-T2] gave more consistent results.  To
avoid stations whose data were very noisy, only stations 19-57 and samples
taken at pressures greater than 800 db were used to determine the quadratic
correction to T1 as a function of pressure.  This correction was applied to
all casts for stations 6-71.

In addition to the aforementioned pressure dependence, the secondary
temperature sensor experienced a slow drift of -0.0021 deg.C from stations
57 to 71.  Offsets that changed with each station# (time) were determined
by comparing [T2-SBE35RT] vs. station.  The new offsets were applied based
on the following equation:




                                    -13-

     {NewT2Offset = OldT2Offset + (station# * 0.00014913440490445) -
0.008489915615745}

Secondary temperature sensor (T2 = S/N 03P-4486) required a pressure-
dependent adjustment as well: it was corrected to the SBE35RT temperature
values, using only values with pressures greater than 1000 db, where
bottles were not fired on the fly.  A first-order fit was applied, using
[T2-SBE35RT] vs. Pressure. Noisy casts were excluded entirely by using only
the following stations were to determine the correction coefficients:
{72-76,81/3-101,103-106}.  This linear T2 correction as a function of
pressure was applied to all casts for stations 72-106.

The deep residual temperature differences after correction are shown in
figures 1.7.2.0 through 1.7.2.5.

The 95% confidence limit for the mean residual temperature differences is

SBE35RT-T1).  The 95% confidence limit for deep residual temperature
differences is +/-0.0020 deg.C for T1-T2, and +/-0.0027 deg.C for SBE35RT-
T1.

1.7.3.  CTD Conductivity

Several SBE4C conductivity sensors were used during I06S.  Primary
conductivity sensor (C1 = S/N 04-3057) was used for stations 1-80, and U.
of Hawaii's (C1 = S/N 04-2790) served as primary for stations 81-106, when
the entire U. of Hawaii CTD package was installed.  Secondary conductivity
sensor (C2 = S/N 04-2115) was used for all stations except the first cast
of station 81, where there were no secondary sensors installed.

Conductivity sensor calibration coefficients derived from the pre-cruise
calibrations were applied to raw primary and secondary conductivities.
Comparisons between the primary and secondary sensors, and between each of
the sensors to check sample conductivities (calculated from bottle
salinities), were used to derive conductivity corrections.  To reduce the
contamination of the comparisons by package wake, differences between
primary and secondary temperature sensors were used as a metric of
variability and used to qualify the comparisons.  The coherence of this
relationship is illustrated in figure 1.7.3.0.


Figure 1.7.3.0 C1-C2 by T1-T2, (-0.02 deg.C<=T1-T2<=0.02 deg.C).


The uncorrected comparison between the primary and secondary conductivity
sensors is shown in figure 1.7.3.1, and between C1 and the bottle
conductivities in 1.7.3.2.


Figure 1.7.3.1 Uncorrected C1-C2 by Station (Pressure > 800db).
Figure 1.7.3.2 Uncorrected BottleCond-C1 by Station (Pressure > 800db).


A first-order [BottleCond-C1] vs. Pressure fit was used to correct (C1 =
S/N 04-3057) to bottle data for stations 1-80, using data with pressures
over 1000 db to avoid bottles that were fired on the fly.  To eliminate
problem casts, only stations [1,2/3,4,5,19-76,79-80] were used to determine
the first-order pressure-dependent corrections applied to all stations
1-80.

Bottle salinities were used to get a preliminary set of correction
coefficients for the primary conductivity sensor (C1 = S/N 04-2790) for




                                    -14-

stations 81-106.  A [BottleCond-C1] vs. Pressure slope and offset were
determined using values with pressures greater than 800 db to avoid areas
where bottles were fired on the fly.  In addition, a first-order correction
using [BottleCond-C1] residual differences vs.  C1 was applied.

Once this preliminary C1 correction was applied to stations 81-106, first-
order (C2 = S/N 04-2115) corrections for stations 1-106 were determined
using [C1-C2] vs. Pressure.  The fit only used non-problematic (noisy)
stations {1,2/3,4,5,19-76,79-83,85-105}, and values with pressures over
1000 db.

After secondary conductivity was corrected for stations 1-106, primary
conductivity sensor (C1 = S/N 04-2790) coefficients were fine-tuned using
[C2-C1] differences for stations 81-106, since [C2-C1] displayed more
consistent differences than [BottleCond-C1] for all stations.  The combined
pressure-dependent and C1-dependent first-order corrections were applied to
C1 for stations 81-106.

A comparison of the primary and secondary conductivity sensors after
applying corrections is summarized in figures 1.7.3.3 through 1.7.3.5.

Salinity residuals after applying final temperature and Conductivity
corrections are summarized in figures 1.7.3.9 through 1.7.3.14.  Only CTD
and bottle salinity data with "acceptable" quality codes are included in
the differences.  Note that only Salinity differences where [T1-T2] is
within +/-0.01 deg.C were used in order to eliminate larger values in
higher-gradient regions.  This shows a more realistic picture of any
residual pressure dependence.

Figures 1.7.3.10 and 1.7.3.13 represent estimates of the low-gradient
salinity accuracy of CLIVAR I06S; the 95% confidence limits are +/-0.0013
PSU (low-gradient S2 relative to S1), and +/-0.0043 PSU (low-gradient CTDS
relative to Bottle Salts).  Figures 1.7.3.11 and 1.7.3.14 estimate the deep
salinity accuracy; the 95% confidence limits are +/-0.0009 PSU (deep S2
relative to S1), and +/-0.0025 PSU (deep CTDS relative to Bottle Salts).
Tables of final Temperature and Conductivity corrections applied to I06S
(non-Trace Metal) CTD casts can be found in Appendix A.

Bottle salinity data were analyzed with two different Autosals, and there
was no notable difference between the results based on deep theta-salinity
comparisons.  CTD salinities were corrected to bottle salinity values
(standardized to P-149 IAPSO standard seawater) for CLIVAR I06S.






                                    -15-

Applying post-cruise Sea-Bird calibrations for the ODF conductivity sensors
would make primary and secondary CTD salinities agree within 0.0005 PSU,
but high by +0.002 to +0.0025 PSU compared to bottle data in deep water for
stations in the 20s and 100s.  The bottle-CTD salinity difference could be
reduced to less than 0.001 PSU by adding a pressure-dependent correction to
the SBE conductivity calibration results.  These pressure effects are not
measured in the SBE calibration facility, where conductivity calibrations
are done at atmospheric pressure.

An additional factor was also considered for the remaining difference: SBE
used IAPSO batch P-148 to standardize the reference/bath water used, and
ODF used batch P-149 shipboard.  Personal communication with Dr. Takeshi
Kawano at JAMSTEC [Kawa09] confirmed that batches P-148/P-149 have been
recently analyzed.  He recommends +0.0002/+0.0008 PSU corrections to
salinity data standardized by these batches, based on using recent batches
with better accuracy as the "standards".  These corrections, plus the need
for a pressure-dependent slope to I06S conductivities, would bring the
discrepancy between SBE post-cruise laboratory calibrations and ODF
shipboard bottle analyses (and corrected CTD data) to less than 0.0005 PSU,
well within WOCE standards.

1.7.4.  CTD Dissolved Oxygen

Three SBE43 dissolved O2 (DO) sensors were used during I06S.  DO sensor
(S/N 43-0872) was used during stations 1-12, and was replaced with (S/N
43-1129) in an attempt to resolve sensor noise issues.  DO sensor (S/N
43-1129) was used during stations 13 through 80, then the entire package
was replaced with the U. of Hawaii CTD and sensors.  U. of Hawaii's DO
sensor (S/N 43-0314) served for the remainder of the cruise.  The sensors
were plumbed into the primary T1/C1 pump circuit after C1 for all casts
except stations 1-3 and 79-80, where they were plumbed into the secondary
circuit.

The DO sensors were corrected to dissolved O2 check samples at bottle stops
by calculating CTD dissolved O2, then minimizing the residuals using a non-
linear least-squares fitting procedure. The fitting procedure determined
the correction coefficients for the sensor model conversion equation, and
was accomplished in stages. The time constants for the exponential terms in
the model were first determined for each sensor.  These time constants are
sensor-specific but applicable to an entire cruise.  Next, casts were fit
individually to check sample data. The resulting correction coefficients
were then smoothed and held constant during a refit to determine sensor
slope and offset.

Standard and blank values for bottle oxygen data were smoothed and the
bottle oxygen recalculated prior to the final fitting of CTD oxygen data.
The time-constants and coefficients used to correct I06S CTD Oxygen data
are listed in Appendix B.

Figures 1.7.4.0-1.7.4.2 show the residual differences between bottle and
corrected CTD O2 where both CTD and bottle oxygen data are quality-coded
"acceptable".  Note that only Dissolved Oxygen differences where [T1-T2] is
within +/-0.01 deg.C were used, in order to eliminate larger values in
higher-gradient regions.  This shows a more realistic picture of any
residual pressure dependence.

Figure 1.7.4.1 O2 residuals by Station (-0.01 deg.C<=T1-T2<=0.01 deg.C).
Figure 1.7.4.2 O2 residuals by Station (Pressure > 800db).


The standard deviations of 3.863 umol/kg for low-gradient oxygens and 1.093
umol/kg for deep oxygens are only presented as general indicators of
goodness of fit.  ODF makes no claims regarding the precision or accuracy
of CTD dissolved O2 data.

The general form of the ODF O2 conversion equation for Clark cells follows
Brown and Morrison [Brow78] and Millard [Mill82], [Owen85].  ODF models
membrane and sensor temperatures with lagged CTD temperatures and a lagged
thermal gradient.  In-situ pressure and temperature are filtered to match
the sensor response. Time-constants for the pressure response Taup, two
temperature responses TauTs and TauTf, and thermal gradient response TaudT




                                    -16-

are fitting parameters.  The thermal gradient term is derived by low-pass
filtering the difference between the fast response (Tf) and slow response
(Ts) temperatures. This term is SBE43-specific and corrects a non-linearity
introduced by analog thermal compensation in the sensor.  The Oc gradient,
dOc/dt, is approximated by low-pass filtering 1st-order Oc differences.
This gradient term attempts to correct for reduction of species other than
O2 at the sensor cathode.  The time-constant for this filter, Tauog, is a
fitting parameter.  Dissolved O2 concentration is then calculated:

     O2ml/l=[c1*Oc+c2]*fsat(S,T,P)*e**(c3*Pl+c4*Tf+c5*Ts+c6*dOc/dt(1.7.4.0)

where:

O2ml/l        = Dissolved O2 concentration in ml/l;
Oc            = Sensor current (uamps);
fsat(S,T,P)   = O2 saturation concentration at S,T,P (ml/l);
S             = Salinity at O2 response-time (PSUs);
T             = Temperature at O2 response-time (deg.C);
P             = Pressure at O2 response-time (decibars);
Pl            = Low-pass filtered pressure (decibars);
Tf            = Fast low-pass filtered temperature (deg.C);
Ts            = Slow low-pass filtered temperature (deg.C);
dOc/dt        = Sensor current gradient (uamps/secs);
dT            = low-pass filtered thermal gradient (Tf - Ts).


1.8.  Bottle Sampling

At the end of each rosette deployment water samples were drawn from the
bottles in the following order:


     o   CFCs
     o   He-3
     o   O2
     o   Oxygen Isotopes
     o   Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC)
     o   Total Alkalinity
     o   pH
     o   C-13 and C-14
     o   Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) and Total Dissolved Nitrogen (TDN)
     o   CDOM
     o   Nutrients
     o   Salinity
     o   Tritium
     o   Silicon Isotopes
     o   O-18 in H2O
     o   Dissolved Black Carbon



One member of the sampling team was designated the sample cop, whose sole
responsibility was to maintain this log and insure that sampling progressed
in the proper drawing order.

Normal sampling practice included opening the drain valve and then the air
vent on the bottle, indicating an air leak if water escaped.  This
observation together with other diagnostic comments (e.g., "lanyard caught
in lid", "valve left open") that might later prove useful in determining
sample integrity were routinely noted on the sample log.  Drawing oxygen
samples also involved taking the sample draw temperature from the bottle.
The temperature was noted on the sample log and was sometimes useful in
determining leaking or mis-tripped bottles.

Once individual samples had been drawn and properly prepared, they were
distributed for analysis.  Oxygen, nutrient and salinity analyses were
performed on computer-assisted (PC) analytical equipment networked to the
data processing computer for centralized data management.

1.9.  Bottle Data Processing

Water samples collected and properties analyzed shipboard were eventually
managed in a relational database (PostgreSQL-8.1.9-1.el5) running on a
Linux system. A web service front-end (OpenACS-5.3.2-2.sts.el5 and




                                    -17-

AOLServer-4.5.0-1sts) provided ship-wide access to CTD and water sample
data.  Web-based facilities included on-demand arbitrary property-property
plots and vertical sections as well as data uploads and downloads.

The sample log and any diagnostic comments were entered into the database
once sampling was completed.  Quality flags associated with sampled
properties were set to indicate that the property had been sampled, and
sample container identifications were noted where applicable (e.g., oxygen
flask number).

Analytical results were provided on a regular basis by the various
analytical groups and incorporated into the database. These results
included a quality code associated with each measured value and followed
the coding scheme developed for the World Ocean Circulation Experiment
(WOCE) Hydrographic Programme (WHP) [Joyc94].

Table 1.9.0 shows the number of samples drawn and the number of times each
WHP sample quality flag was assigned for each basic hydrographic property:

Additionally, all WHP water bottle/sample quality code comments are

Various consistency checks and detailed examination of the data continued
during and after the cruise until final data were submitted to CCHDO.

1.10.  Salinity Analysis

Equipment and Techniques

Two Guildline Autosal 8400A salinometers (S/Ns 57-526 and 69-180), located
in the hydro lab, were used for salinity measurements.  Autosal 69-180 was
employed at the start of the expedition, with the bath temperature set at
24 deg.C.  Autosal 57-526 was set up with the bath temperature set at 21
deg.C for use when the lab temperature was low.  When the function switch
on Autosal 57-526 malfunctioned while running station 95, Autosal 69-180
bath temperature was re-set to 21 deg.C and used for the remainder of the
cruise.

The salinometers were configured by SIO/STS to provide an interface for
computer-aided measurement.


Sampling and Data Processing

The salinity analyses were performed after samples had equilibrated to
laboratory temperature, for a minimum of 8 hours after collection.  The
salinometers were standardized for each group of analyses (usually 1-2
casts, up to ~75 samples) using at least two fresh vials of standard
seawater per group.

Salinometer measurements were computer assisted, the analyst prompted by
the software to change samples and flush.






                                    -18-

3258 salinity measurements were made for the main rosette casts, plus 182
for Trace Metals casts and 127 for the underway system.

Salinity samples were drawn into 200 ml Kimax high-alumina borosilicate
bottles, which were rinsed three times with sample prior to filling.  The
bottles were sealed with custom-made plastic insert thimbles and Nalgene
screw caps.  This assembly provides very low container dissolution and
sample evaporation.  Prior to sample collection, inserts were inspected for
proper fit and loose inserts replaced to insure an airtight seal.  The draw
time and equilibration time were logged for all casts.  Laboratory
temperatures were logged at the beginning and end of each run.  PSS-78
salinity [UNES81] was calculated for each sample from the measured
conductivity ratios.  The difference (if any) between the initial vial of
standard water and the next one run as an unknown was applied to the data
as a linear function of elapsed run time.  The corrected salinity data were
then incorporated into the cruise database.  The estimated accuracy of
bottle salinities run at sea is usually better than +/-0.002 PSU relative
to the particular standard seawater batch used.


Laboratory Temperature

The air temperature change during any particular run varied from -1.6 to
+1.3 deg.C with one run varying by 3.1 deg.C.  The water bath temperature
was set and maintained at a value near the laboratory air temperature.  Due
to the fluctuating lab temperature the two Autosals were set up with
different water bath temperatures.  Autosal 69-180 was set at 24 deg.C (21
deg.C after station 95), and 57-526 was set at 21 deg.C.  The temperature
in the salinometer laboratory varied from ~17 to 26 deg.C, during the
cruise. The lab temperature dropped to ~17 deg.C when the ship's engineers
cleared a clogged cooling pipe.

The following table provides a summary of the bath and lab temperature
ranges.

Standards

IAPSO Standard Seawater Batch P-149 (K15=0.99984) was used to standardize
all casts.  Approximately 164 vials of standard seawater were used during
the cruise.

1.11.  Oxygen Analysis

Equipment and Techniques

Dissolved oxygen analyses were performed with an SIO/ODF-designed automated
oxygen titrator using photometric end-point detection based on the
absorption of 365nm wavelength ultra-violet light.  The titration of the
samples and the data logging were controlled by a PC using LabView
software.  Thiosulfate was dispensed by a Dosimat 665 buret driver fitted
with a 1.0ml buret.  ODF used a whole-bottle modified-Winkler titration
following the technique of Carpenter [Carp65] with modifications by
Culberson et al. [Culb91], but with higher concentrations of potassium
iodate standard (~0.012N) and thiosulfate solution (~55 gm/l).  Pre-made
liquid potassium iodate standards were run daily (approximately every 2-4
stations), unless changes were made to the system or reagents.
Reagent/distilled water blanks were also determined daily, or more often if
a change in reagents required it to account for presence of oxidizing or
reducing agents.





                                    -19-

Sampling and Data Processing

3295 oxygen measurements were made for the main rosette casts, plus 91 for
the underway system.  Samples were collected for dissolved oxygen analyses
soon after the rosette was brought on board.  Using a Tygon and silicone
drawing tube, nominal 125ml volume-calibrated iodine flasks were rinsed 3
times with minimal agitation, then filled and allowed to overflow for at
least 3 flask volumes.  The sample drawing temperatures were measured with
an electronic resistance temperature detector (RTD) embedded in the drawing
tube.  These temperatures were used to calculate umol/kg concentrations,
and as a diagnostic check of bottle integrity.  Reagents (MnCl2 then
NaI/NaOH) were added to fix the oxygen before stoppering.  The flasks were
shaken twice (10-12 inversions each time) to assure thorough dispersion of
the precipitate, once immediately after drawing, and then again after about
20 minutes.

Samples were analyzed within 1-4 hours of collection, and the data
incorporated into the cruise database.

Thiosulfate normalities were calculated from each standardization and
corrected to 20 deg.C.  The 20 deg.C normalities and the blanks were
plotted versus time and were reviewed for possible problems.  The blanks
and thiosulfate normality was smoothed (linear fit) over the course of the
cruise and the oxygen values recalculated.

Volumetric Calibration

Oxygen flask volumes were determined gravimetrically with degassed
deionized water to determine flask volumes at ODF's chemistry laboratory.
This was done once before using flasks for the first time and periodically
thereafter when a suspect volume is detected.  The volumetric flasks used
in preparing standards were volume-calibrated by the same method, as was
the 10 ml Dosimat buret used to dispense standard iodate solution.

Standards

Liquid potassium iodate standards were prepared in 6-liter batches and
bottled in sterile glass bottles at ODF's chemistry laboratory prior to the
expedition.  The normality of the liquid standard was determined by
calculation from weight.  The standard was supplied by Alfa Aesar and has a
reported purity of 99.4-100.4%.  All other reagents were "reagent grade"
and were tested for levels of oxidizing and reducing impurities prior to
use.

1.12.  Nutrient Analysis

Equipment and Techniques

Nutrient analyses (phosphate, silicate, nitrate and nitrite) were performed
on an ODF-modified 4-channel Technicon AutoAnalyzer II, generally within
one to two hours after sample collection.

The methods used are described by Gordon et al. [Gord92].  The analog
outputs from each of the four colorimeter channels were digitized and
logged automatically by computer (PC) at 2-second intervals. After each
group of samples was analyzed, the raw data file was processed to produce
another file of response factors, baseline values, and absorbances.
Computer-produced absorbance readings were checked for accuracy against
values taken from a strip chart recording which is produced simultaneously
with the computer.  Concentrations were then calculated, any non-linear
corrections applied, and data merged with other hydrographic measurements.
Nutrients, reported in micromoles per kilogram, were converted from
micromoles per liter by dividing by sample density calculated at 1 atm
pressure (0 db), in-situ salinity, and an assumed laboratory temperature of
25 deg.C.

Silicate was analyzed using the technique of Armstrong et al. [Arms67].  An
acidic solution of ammonium molybdate was added to a seawater sample to
produce silicomolybdic acid which was then reduced to silicomolybdous acid
(a blue compound) following the addition of stannous chloride.  Tartaric
acid was also added to impede PO4 color development.  The sample was passed
through a 15mm flowcell and the absorbance measured at 660nm.






                                    -20-

A modification of the Armstrong et al. [Arms67] procedure was used for the
analysis of nitrate and nitrite.  For the nitrate analysis, the seawater
sample was passed through a cadmium reduction column where nitrate was
quantitatively reduced to nitrite.  Sulfanilamide was introduced to the
sample stream followed by N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride
which coupled to form a red azo dye.  The stream was then passed through a
15mm flowcell and the absorbance measured at 540nm.  The same technique was
employed for nitrite analysis, except the cadmium column was bypassed, and
a 50mm flowcell was used for measurement.

Phosphate was analyzed using a modification of the Bernhardt and Wilhelms
[Bern67] technique.  An acidic solution of ammonium molybdate was added to
the sample to produce phosphomolybdic acid, then reduced to
phosphomolybdous acid (a blue compound) following the addition of
dihydrazine sulfate.  The reaction product was heated to ~55 deg.C to
enhance color development, then passed through a 50mm flowcell and the
absorbance measured at 820nm.

Explicit corrections for carryover in nutrient analyses are not made.  In a
typical AutoAnalyzer system, sample to sample carryover is ~1-2% of the
concentration difference between samples.  This effect is minimized by
running samples in order of increasing depth such that concentration
differences between samples are minimized.  The initial surface samples
were run twice since these samples followed standard peaks.

Sampling and Data Processing

3301 nutrient samples were analyzed for the main rosette casts, plus 192
samples for Trace Metals casts and 95 underway samples.

Nutrient samples were drawn into 40 ml polypropylene screw-capped
centrifuge tubes.  The tubes and caps were cleaned with 10% HCl and rinsed
once with de-ionized water and 2-3 times with sample before filling.
Samples were analyzed within two hours after sample collection, allowing
sufficient time for all samples to reach room temperature.  The centrifuge
tubes fit directly onto the sampler.  Standardizations were performed at
the beginning and end of each group of analyses (typically one cast, up to
36 samples) with an intermediate concentration mixed nutrient standard
prepared prior to each run from a secondary standard in a low-nutrient
seawater matrix.  The secondary standards were prepared aboard ship by
dilution from primary standard solutions.  Dry standards were pre-weighed
at the laboratory at ODF, and transported to the vessel for dilution to the
primary standard.  Sets of 7 different standard concentrations were
analyzed periodically to determine any deviation from linearity as a
function of absorbance for each nutrient analysis.  A correction for non-
linearity was applied to the final nutrient concentrations when necessary.
A correction for the difference in refractive indices of pure distilled
water and seawater was periodically determined and applied.  In addition, a
"deep seawater" high nutrient concentration check sample was run with each
station as an additional check on data quality.  The pump tubing was
changed 3 times during I06S.

After each group of samples was analyzed, the raw data file was processed
to produce another file of response factors, baseline values, and
absorbances.  Final nutrient concentrations were then determined from this
file, and the data were added to the cruise database.

Nutrients, reported in micromoles per kilogram, were converted from
micromoles per liter by dividing by sample density calculated at 1 atm
pressure (0 db), in situ salinity, and a per-analysis measured analytical
temperature.

Standards

Primary standards for silicate (Na2SiF6) and nitrite (NaNO2) were obtained
from Johnson Matthey Chemical Co.; the supplier reported purities of >98%
and 97%, respectively. Primary standards for nitrate (KNO3) and phosphate
(KH2PO4) were obtained from Fisher Chemical Co.; the supplier reported
purities of 99.999% and 99.999%, respectively.  The efficiency of the
cadmium column used for nitrate was monitored throughout the cruise and
ranged from 99-100%.

No major problems were encountered with the measurements.  The temperature
of the laboratory used for the analyses ranged from 23.0 deg.C to 24.5
deg.C.

1.13.  Historical Comparison

Comparing 1996 and 2008 I06S and 2006 P16S and 2007 I08N T, S, O2, and
nutrient values (J.Swift)

Head-to-head comparisons of recent ODF I06S, I08S and P16S salinity,
dissolved oxygen, and nutrient data values show that meridional water mass
variability dominates the differences.  Water mass characteristics change
considerably from I06S to I08S and to P16S, due to mixing and introduction
of different source waters.  All three data sets show very high internal
quality and consistency, and the meridional changes are of the expected
sign and magnitude in every case.  These three sections can thus be
expected to add considerably to knowledge and study of circumpolar southern
hemisphere variations in water masses and circulation.

The 2008 I06S bottle salinity, oxygen, and nutrient data exhibit a high
degree of internal consistency.  Trends and the principal station-to-
station fluctuations appear to be associated with oceanographic features.

For the most part deep temperatures - except for the 41-53 deg.S band - are
slightly warmer than the 1996 values, typically by a little more than 0.05
deg.C.  This is a relatively large difference and would seem to have
oceanographic relevance.

Deep CTD salinity shows nearly the same pattern, and is a bit higher in
2008 than in 1996, again except for the 41-53 deg.S band.  The typical deep
CTDS difference is in the 0.003-0.005 range.

The 41-53 deg.S band is a steep frontal region and the changed sign of the
differences there could have been the result of a shift northward in the
front in 2008.

The 1996 I06S nutrient data are noisier than and in some cases offset from
the 2008 nutrient data.  For example, SiO3 at 3000 meters at 57 deg.S was
ca. 152 umol/kg in 1996 and 131 umol/kg in 2008.  Silicate differences were
often ca. 10-20 umol/kg across the section, and of the same sign, except
for ca. 41-53 deg.S where the 2008 values were higher.

Deep PO4 values are generally higher in the 2008 data than in the 1996 data
(except perhaps for some of the 41-53 deg.S band).  The average offset is
on the order of 0.05 umol/kg.  Deep NO3 values are also generally higher in
a similar manner.  The average offset appears to be a little less than 1
umol/kg.

Deep dissolved oxygens appear to be within a few hundredths of a ml/l of
each other for the most part across the section.  Differences are a little
larger (2008 is higher) in the 41-53 deg.S frontal range.

Argo Floats

During the CLIVAR/CO2 2008 repeat of I6S, 17 autonomous CTD profiling floats 
were deployed along the cruise track in waters deeper than 2000 dbar. These 
floats are part of the Argo project (www.argo.ucsd.edu), and are provided by Dr. 
Steve Riser from the University of Washington and Dr. Ann Thresher of CSIRO, 
Australia. 

Of these 17 floats, 2 contain oxygen sensors, and 13 floats use ice detection. 
Float #5257  Apf9iIdoOpt is an Iridium float that carries two O2 sensors aboard, 
the Seabird IDO Oxygen sensor and Anderaa Optode Oxygen sensor. Float #5221 
Apf9aIdoIce is an Iridium float that carries the Seabird IDO Oxygen Sensor as 
well as ice detection. There were 12 Argos Ice Detection Floats (Apf9aIce) and 
one Iridium ice detection float (5221).

The ice detection floats are programmed to abort their surface mission if 
freezing temperatures are detected near the surface, and, in the case of the 
Iridium float, to store data when under sea ice. All floats were deployed at CTD 
stations, at the end of all station casts. All floats were deployed from the 
starboard stern of the ship, with the ship moving forward at about 0.5-1 knot. 
Deployment was done by using a rope to lower the floats from the deck to the 
water, except in the roughest conditions (see below). Data from all Argo floats 
are publicly available in real-time via the two global servers at 
www.usgodae.org and www.coriolis.eu.org. 

Argo "Nitrate" float number 5146 (Apf9iIsus) was deployed at:

Date:   19 Feb 2008
Time:   1900
Lat:    50 12.00 S
Lon:    30 0.00 E
Depth:  4875m

This float was deployed in rough conditions (~ 35 kts, 3.5 m swell) following 
the recommended deployment procedure. The float was lowered into the water and 
began to drift away from the ship. One end was secured on a cleat, and the free 
end was thrown overboard. Unfortunately, as the float drifted off the line, the 
boat was pitching a lot so the line tensioned fast, causing it to foul on the 
free end. At this point a couple of big waves came through causing the boat to 
pitch violently and the line was pulled off the cleat, such that the float still 
has the line attached. Subsequently, the float has continued to profile at a 
somewhat deeper depth than that for which it was ballasted. For float 
deployments in large seas that followed this one the float was simply dropped 
off the starboard aft deck as a wave came up to its highest position, typically 
close to deck level. In this manner the rest of the floats were deployed without 
incident. As of the end of the cruise, the "Nitrate Float" was still operational 
and had completed 12 profiles
        (http://runt.ocean.washington.edu/argo/homographs/TP/5146.html).

The following are the approximate positions where the 14 floats were deployed 
(floats not designated CSIRO are from UW):

Lowered Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers 
(Tom Kilpatrick, UH.)

We used a 150 kHz broadband ADCP (BB150), manufactured by R.D.I. Instruments. 
The BB150 was built in the mid-1990s and provides greater profiling range than 
the newer 300 kHz instruments, mainly due to the lower frequency. The other, 
backup unit, was a 300kHz "work horse" ADCP from FSU. The LADCP system is self-
contained, attached to the rosette but disconnected from the lab during 
deployment. The power source is a 52 V lead-acid gel cell battery system, 
contained in an oil-filled plastic box sealed by a urethane sheet. The battery 
system is known as the Safe Orange Battery (SOB) due to the case's color. After 
each CTD deployment, the rosette is recovered and brought into the hangar. Then 
the LADCP system is connected to the wet lab. The downloading of data and 
charging of SOB happen simultaneously.

The BB150 performed well during the cruise, with a few compromised casts due to 
SOB failure (see below). There were also several cable failures which did not 
affect the data.
In all, there is data for 125 casts, though I believe the data for station 97 is 
noise. There is no data at all for cast 17 of station 91 (yo-yo station).

Cables
The primary problem during the cruise was with the cables. A Y-cable is used to 
connect the BB150, SOB, and wet lab. The Y-cable is mounted on the rosette. 
Inside the Y-cable a diode exists to prevent voltage from the SOB reaching the 
inside of the wet lab (the user). Three diodes failed on the cruise: two in Y-
cables; and one in a ''star-cable,'' which is a Y-cable with two extra 
connectors and one extra diode. By the end of the cruise we were using the last 
good diode. When the diode fails, continuity is destroyed and the SOB cannot be 
charged. The diode does not affect data download, which went smoothly the entire 
trip. 

A strong possibility is that the diode failures were due to stress. When we 
charge the SOB, current runs through the Y-cable and heats the rubber. The 
outside of the Y-cable is cold from the water and the air temperatures. The 
differential stretching of the inside/outside might have been enough to break 
the diode or displace it from the wire. Clearly a new cable design is called 
for, or perhaps a Y-cable without a diode. Other than the nuisance of changing 
cables three times, the only consequence of the diode failures was that we did 
some casts without the SOB being fully charged. That is fine, as the SOB is 
believed to have a capacity of six casts without being charged (Eric Firing, 
personal communication).

Battery
The SOB failed to provide enough power to the BB150 on stations 91, and 97-99, 
but I believe those problems are separate from the diode failures. Station 91 
was the ``yo-yo'' cast, when we did 16 consecutive ctd casts without recharging 
the battery. The instrument stopped pinging prior to the last cast, indicating 
that the battery was dead.

The signal/noise ratio deteriorates during the second half of the yo-yo cast, 
but the actual current measurements look okay through cast 16 (cast 17 missing). 
Current measurements from casts 14-16 are missing some of the shallower bins, 
presumably due to noise. We might be able to fill those gaps in with the 
shipboard ADCP. After the yo-yo casts the SOB recharged enough to work for 92-96 
(though those were shallow casts). But on 97 the instrument again stopped 
pinging prior to CTD recovery. There are probably no good data from station 97. 
Stations 98 and 99 looked okay going down, but not going up. After 99 we 
replaced the SOB with the spare.

However, the SOB was acting strange earlier in the cruise. On stations 74-80, it 
was drawing very little current, sometimes completing charging in less than a 
minute (it normally takes more than 30 minutes). Since the cables were fine 
then, something was wrong with the SOB.

Another variable is that after we first changed the Y-cable (around station 47), 
we also modified the charging procedure. On the advice of Bruce Huber, after the 
current dropped to 0.5 A at the full 57 V, we reduced the voltage to 54 or 54.5 
and let the SOB ``trickle-charge'' (0.1-0.3A) until the next station. Prior to 
Bruce's advice we turned the charger off at 0.5 A. Bruce told us that it can 
take a long to time to ``top off'' the SOB with the trickle-charge. It is 
possible that the modified charging procedure could be responsible for the odd 
behavior from stations 74-80, i.e. the SOB was so well-charged it didn't want to 
take much current.

UH uses the shear method of Fischer and Visbeck (1993) to calculate u and v. A 
shear estimate is made for each depth bin, and then the shear profile is 
integrated to give a baroclinic current profile. The reference velocity (i.e. 
offset or barotropic profile) is calculated using GPS measurements of ship 
position. In the UH processing, the down/up profiles are computed separately, so 
the agreement of the two gives some estimate of the error. At most stations, 
down and up agree to within a few cm/s. However there are some stations with 
large errors. 

We use half-second time series of CTD data to help improve the depth estimate of 
the LADCP, a prime source of error. Most stations have been processed with the 
CTD data, the exceptions being 4-1,5-2,15-2,70-2,71-2,72-3,80-3.

Observations of note

We observed a deep eddy at stations 75 and 76, with anomalous water properties 
(Si and CFCs). At station 75 the current was centered at 3500 m, flowing NE. It 
appears to be slope water that has separated from the Gunnerus Ridge. Other 
stations appear to have deep eddies but have not been checked for anomalous 
water properties.

The yo-yo casts at 91 give us some idea of tidal variability, at least in the 
Gunnerus Bank area. The southwest flow does decrease in magnitude over the 
duration of the yo-yo, but does not reverse direction. Finally, at many stations 
there were strong scattering layers. 


Shipboard Doppler Current Profilers

The Revelle has three Doppler sonars for measuring ocean velocity. One of these, 
a commercial 150kHz narrowband instrument, is considered to be the primary 
shipboard current profiler for CLIVAR cruises. The other two "High- resolution 
Doppler Sonar System" (HDSS, 50kHz and 140kHz) were designed at Scripps 
Institute of Oceanography specifically for installation on the Revelle. Their 
design characteristics were optimized for high-quality ocean shear measurements, 
and the ability to provide high-quality ocean velocity is under evaluation. 
Comparison of the ocean velocity data from the HDSS and RDI instruments will 
enable a decision as to whether the HDSS velocities should be included in the 
shipboard final ocean velocity dataset. 

The CLIVAR Shipboard Ocean Velocity component

The primary instrument (NB150) was made by R.D. Instruments (now owned by  
Teledyne) in the late 1980s.  The original commercial acquisition and averaging 
software ran under DOS and required a fairly slow computer.  A new  acquisition 
system written at the University of Hawaii is installed on an SIO-owned rack-
mount unit. 

The acquisition system (UHDAS, University of Hawaii Data Acquisition System) is 
written in C and Python; processing software is in C, Python, and Matlab.   
UHDAS acquires data from the NB150 instrument, gyro heading (for reliability),  
Ashtech heading (for accuracy), and GPS positions from various sensors.   
Single-ping data are converted from beam to earth coordinates using known  
transducer angles and gyro heading, and are corrected by the average Ashtech-
gyro difference over the duration of the 5-minute profile.  This scheme  
insulates the heading correction against short gaps or loss of fixes.  For 
Ashtech gaps (up to 2 hours), the previous available correction is used.

Groups of single-ping ocean velocity estimates must be averaged to  decrease  
measurement noise.  These groups commonly comprise 5 minutes. Bad pings must  be 
edited out prior to averaging.  This is done by UHDAS using a collection  of 
criteria tailored to the instrument type and frequency, and to the  specific 
installation.

UHDAS uses a CODAS (Common Oceanographic Data Access System) database for 
storage and retrieval of averaged data.  Various post-processing steps can be 
administered to the database after a cruise is over, but the at-sea data should 
be acceptable for preliminary work.

UHDAS provides access to regularly-updated figures and data via the ship's  
network.  The software used is all open-source and is available via samba  share 
and nfs export, as well as through the web interface. The shipboard web site has 
regularly-updated figures showing the last 5-minute ocean velocity profile with 
signal return strength, and hourly contour and vector plots of the last  3 days 
of ocean velocity. 



CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, and CCl4
(Jim Happell and Charlene Grall, RSMAS)

Sample Collection

All samples were collected from depth using 10.4 liter Niskin bottles. None of 
the Niskin bottles used showed a CFC contamination throughout the cruise. All 
bottles in use remained inside the CTD hanger between casts.  

CFC sampling was conducted first at each station, according to WOCE protocol. 
This avoids contamination by air introduced at the top of the Niskin bottle as 
water was being removed. A water sample was collected directly from the Niskin 
bottle petcock using a 100 ml ground glass syringe which was fitted with a 
three-way stopcock that allowed flushing without removing the syringe from the 
petcock.  Syringes were flushed several times and great care was taken to avoid 
contamination by air bubbles. One duplicate sample was taken on most stations 
from random Niskin bottles.  Air samples, pumped into the system using an Air 
Cadet pump from a Dekoron air intake hose mounted high on the foremast were run 
when time permitted, and for several days during the long steam to Capetown. Air 
measurements are used as a check on accuracy.


Equipment and technique

Chlorofluorocarbons CFC-11, CFC-12, and CFC-113 were measured on 106 stations 
for a total of 3,324 samples.   Halocarbon analyses were performed on a gas 
chromatograph (GC) equipped with an electron capture detector (ECD). Samples 
were introduced into the GC-EDC via a purge and dual trap system. The samples 
were purged with nitrogen and the compounds of interest were trapped on a main 
Porapack N trap held at ~ -15oC with a Vortec Tube cooler. After the sample had 
been purged and trapped for several minutes at high flow, the gas stream was 
stripped of any water vapor via a magnesium perchlorate trap prior to transfer 
to the main trap. The main trap was isolated and heated by direct resistance to 
140oC. The desorbed contents of the main trap were back-flushed and transferred, 
with helium gas, over a short period of time, to a small volume focus trap in 
order to improve chromatographic peak shape. The focus trap was also Porapak N 
and is held at ~ -15 oC with a Vortec Tube cooler. The focus trap was flash 
heated by direct resistance to 155 oC to release the compounds of interest onto 
the analytical pre-column.  The pre-column was the first 5 meters of a 60 m 
Gaspro capillary column with the main column consisting of the remaining 55 
meters. The analytical pre-column was held in-line with the main analytical 
column for the first 1.5 minutes of the chromatographic run. After 1.5 minutes, 
all of the compounds of interest were on the main column and the pre-column was 
switched out of line and back-flushed with a relatively high flow of nitrogen 
gas. This prevented later eluting compounds from building up on the analytical 
column, eventually eluting and causing the detector baseline signal to increase. 

The syringes were stored in a flow-through seawater bath and analyzed within 8 -
12 hours after collection.   Bath temperature was recorded continuously for use 
in calculating the mass of water analyzed.  Every 12 to 18 measurements were 
followed by a purge blank and a standard, gas7.175ml. The surface sample was 
held after measurement and was sent through the process in order to "restrip" it 
to determine the efficiency of the purging process. 


Calibration 

A gas phase standard, S39, was used for calibration. The concentrations of the 
CFCs in this standard are reported on the SIO 1998 absolute calibration scale. 
Six calibration curves were run over the course of the cruise. Estimated 
accuracy is +/- 2%. Precision for CFC-12, CFC-11, CFC-113 and CCl4 was less than 
1%. Estimated limit of detection is 0.010 pM/kg for CFC-12 and CFC-113, and 
0.005 pM/kg for CFC-11 and CCl4.

Technical Problems

In large part, sample collection and measurement were very successful. The 
integration of the computer software with the GC-EDC system hardware made the 
procedure almost completely automated. There were no incidents that caused 
significant instrument down time.



Total CO2 Measurements
(Esa Peltola, NOAA AOML)

Samples for TCO2 measurements were drawn according to procedures outlined in the 
Handbook of Methods for CO2 Analysis (DOE 1994) from 10.4-L Niskin bottles into 
cleaned 294-mL glass bottles. Bottles were rinsed and filled from the bottom, 
leaving 6 mL of headspace; care was taken not to entrain any bubbles. After 0.2 
mL of saturated HgCl2 solution was added as a preservative, the sample bottles 
were sealed with glass stoppers lightly covered with Apiezon-L grease and were 
stored at room temperature for a maximum of 12 hours prior to analysis.

A total of 2105 TCO2 samples were collected from variety of depths with one to 
three replicate samples. Typically the replicate seawater samples were taken 
from the surface and and/or bottom Niskin bottles and run at different times 
during the cell. No systematic difference between the replicates was observed. 

The TCO2 analytical equipment was set up in a seagoing laboratory van. The 
analysis was done by coulometry with two analytical systems (AOML3 and AOML4) 
used simultaneously on the cruise. Each system consisted of a coulometer (UIC, 
Inc.) coupled with a Dissolved Inorganic Carbon Extractor (DICE) inlet system. 
DICE was developed by Esa Peltola and Denis Pierrot of NOAA/AOML and Dana 
Greeley of  NOAA/PMEL to modernize a carbon extractor called SOMMA (Johnson et 
al. 1985, 1987, 1993, and 1999; Johnson 1992). In the coulometric analysis of 
TCO2, all carbonate species are converted to CO2 (gas) by addition of excess 
hydrogen ion (acid) to the seawater sample, and the evolved CO2 gas is swept 
into the titration cell of the coulometer with pure air or compressed nitrogen, 
where it reacts quantitatively with a proprietary reagent based on ethanolamine 
to generate hydrogen ions. In this process, the solution changes from blue to 
colorless, which triggers a current through the cell and causes coulometrical 
generation of OH- ions at the anode. The OH- ions react with the H+, and the 
solution turns blue again. A beam of light is shone through the solution, and a 
photometric detector at the opposite side of the cell senses the change in 
transmission. Once the percent transmission reaches its original value, the 
coulometric titration is stopped, and the amount of CO2 that enters the cell is 
determined by integrating the total charge during the titration.

The coulometers were calibrated by injecting aliquots of pure CO2 (99.995%) by 
means of an 8-port valve outfitted with two sample loops with known gas volumes  
bracketing the amount of CO2 extracted from the water samples for the two AOML 
systems.

The stability of each coulometer cell solution was confirmed three different 
ways: the Certified Reference Material (CRM), Batch 85, supplied by Dr. A. 
Dickson of SIO, was measured at the beginning; gas loops in the beginning and at 
the end; and the duplicate samples at the beginning, middle, and end of each 
cell solution. The coulometer cell solution was replaced after 25 mg of carbon 
was titrated, typically after 9-12 hours of continuous use.

The pipette volume was determined by taking aliquots at known temperature of 
distilled water from the volumes. The weights with the appropriate densities 
were used to determine the volume of the pipettes. 

Calculation of the amount of CO2 injected was according to the CO2 handbook (DOE 
1994). The concentration of CO2 ([CO2]) in the samples was determined according 
to:


                              (Counts - Blank * Run Time) * K µmol/count
        [CO2] = Cal. Factor * ------------------------------------------
                                  pipette volume * density of sample

where Cal. Factor is the calibration factor, Counts is the instrument reading at 
the end of the analysis, Blank is the counts/minute determined from blank runs 
performed at least once for each cell solution, Run Time is the length of 
coulometric titration (in minutes), and K is the conversion factor from counts 
to µmol.

The instrument has a salinity sensor, but all TCO2 values were recalculated to a 
molar weight (µmol/kg) using density obtained from the CTD's salinity and bottle 
salinity where CTD salinity was not available. The TCO2 values were corrected 
for dilution by 0.2 mL of saturated HgCl2 used for sample preservation. The 
total water volume of the sample bottles was 288 mL (calibrated by Esa Peltola, 
AOML). The correction factor used for dilution was 1.0007. A correction was also 
applied for the offset from the CRM. This correction was applied for each cell 
using the CRM value obtained in the beginning of the cell. The results underwent 
initial quality control on the ship using TCO2-Pressure plots. 

The overall performance of the instruments was good during the cruise. The 
computers had occasionally serial communication problems and valve 13 broke on 
both machines, on AOML4 twice.

pH
(Brendan Carter, SIO)

The I6S line was occupied from February 4th to March 17th 2008.  Measurements of 
hydrographic parameters were made on seawater retrieved from depth with a 
sampling rosette at 106 stations.  The carbon system was characterized by 
measurements of total alkalinity (TA), hydrogen ion concentration (pH), and 
dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC).  The methods employed for the pH analyses are 
described below.
Roughly 2050 measurements of pH are reported.  Whenever possible, pH samples 
were collected where DIC and TA were also collected.  Precision of the reported 
values is estimated from roughly 300 pairs of duplicate analyses collected from 
single rosette bottles.  Several procedural changes made during the course of 
the cruise were found to affect the precision.  For stations 1-24 the precision 
is estimated at 0.003 pH units.  For stations 25-73, the precision is estimated 
to be 0.001 pH units.  For all remaining stations the precision is estimated at 
0.0005 pH units.

Hydrogen ion concentration is reported on the total scale described in the DOE 
handbook as the negative logarithm base 10 of the concentration in mols/kg 
seawater.  Measurements were made using a modified version of the procedure 
described in Clayton and Byrne 1993 with spectrophotometric measurements of pH-
sensitive m-cresol purple dye added to seawater.  Measurements were made 
relative to 20°C for stations numbered 1-24, and at 13°C for all subsequent 
stations.  

Sample handling and dye addition was performed with a Kloehn (V6) syringe pump 
automated with Labview 8.2 software.  Spectrophotometric measurements were made 
using a 10 cm jacketed cell with a single-beam Agilent 8453 spectrophotometer.  
Several measures were taken to prevent introduction of bubbles from the Kloehn 
syringe into the beampath of the spectrophotometer including tilting the 
beampath, installing a HPLC debubbler, and including a pressure relief valve 
downstream of the spectrophotometer to keep the fluid line pressurized.  Samples 
were refrigerated at 8°C in 250 mL Pyrex bottles with several different types of 
closures following collection from the rosette and before analysis.

Total Alkalinity
(George Anderson, SIO)

The total alkalinity analyses performed during I6S, were performed using a two-
stage, potentiometric, open-cell titration and coulometrically analyzed 
hydrochloric acid. The acid was prepared using sodium chloride to give the 
solution an ionic strength of approximately 0.7. Using a calibrated pipet, a 
known volume of sample was acidified to a pH slightly above 3.5 with an aliquot 
of titrant. The solution was stirred for five minutes to allow the evolved CO2 
to escape. The titration was then continued to a pH slightly below 3.0 and the 
equivalence point evaluated from titration points in the pH region 3.0 to 3.5, 
using a non-linear least squares procedure that corrects for the reactions with 
sulfate and fluoride ions. (Dickson paper reference will be found at the end of 
this write-up).
A LabView based software package was used on a Dell laptop computer to do the 
computer assisted sample analyses. This was the first time this combination of 
software/PC based computer have been used in the sea-going alkalinity system.  
There were a few hardware and software problems, none of which prevented the 
analyses from being completed. 

With the exception of one station, (station 8) at which a surface sample only 
was collected, samples were collected at every level on the odd stations and 
half or more of the levels on the alternate stations. Samples were always taken 
when dissolved inorganic carbon (D.I.C.) or C-14 samples were taken.  Typically 
duplicate samples were drawn one for each 10 Niskins cast at a station. For a 36 
bottle cast, the duplicates were drawn from the surface or near surface Niskin 
(34-36), a mid-depth sample around Niskin 18 and the bottom or near bottom 
Niskin (bottles 1-3). The choice of Niskins for the duplicates depended on what 
other samples were to be drawn from a Niskin and the volume requirements for 
these samples. 

Samples were drawn using a silicon drawing tube (as provided) into 250 ml pyrex 
serum bottles after triple rinsing. 0.057 milliliters of a saturated solution of 
mercuric chloride were added to all samples from stations north of 60 degrees 
south. This was done using an Eppendorf pipettor.  Below this latitude, the 
mercuric chloride was only added to samples in the upper 300 meters of the water 
column to insure that poisoned samples could be discarded into the 55 gallon 
drums reserved for chemical waste. 

Samples were analyzed using a two cell system: a sample being titrated in one 
cell while a sample was added to the second cell allowing time for the sample in 
this cell to come to temperature equilibrium while the sample in the first cell 
was being titrated. The sample cells were jacketted. A bath was used to keep 
sample temperatures at 20 degrees Celsius. With very cold samples, a small pail 
with water at or about 35 degrees C. was used to bring these samples to a 
temperature close to 20 degrees C. 

The volume of sample titrated was measured using a calibrated pipet of 
approximately 100 mls. The calibration was performed using deionized water and a 
top loader balance readable to 0.01 grams. The balance was set up on the ship. 
The balance was stable within a range of plus or minus 0.20 grams, an 
unacceptable range for this calibration. The balance was moved to the pier 
adjacent to the ship. Although a bit awkward, using the balance on the pier 
worked quite well. The pipet volume had a standard deviation less than 0.01%. 

As installed in the system (see next paragraph) the pipet was wrapped with 
insulation with the temperature of the water being determined using a calibrated 
YSI thermometer readable to 0.01 degrees C. The flat metal thermister of the 
thermometer probe was attached to the side of the pipet inside the insulation.  
Earlier tests in the laboratory, well before the cruise, confirmed that this 
scheme would provide a temperature good to better than 0.05 degrees C. 

A semi-automated system was used to move the seawater from the sample bottles 
into and out of the pipet and into the jacketted titration vessels. This worked 
the entire cruise with no problems. This system consisted of a peristaltic pump, 
set to fill the pipet in about 60 seconds, an XT programmable controller to turn 
the pump, solenoid values, and an air pump on and off at appropriate times, the 
solenoid valves mentioned, and various fittings and tubing. The air pump was 
used to expel the sample from the pipet and allow a 15 second blow-out period to 
remove solution from the pipet and delivery tubing.

As samples were analyzed, the values were entered into an Excel spreadsheet into 
which preliminary bottle pressures had been entered. This enabled one to see an 
alkalinity versus pressure plot as one proceeded with the analyses. This proved 
very helpful in spotting samples that should or could be rerun.  

System performance was monitored two ways: 1) bottles of a certified reference 
material, Batch 86 (Dickson lab) were run approximately once per watch, 2) 
duplicate samples were drawn and run on all but a few casts. On 36 bottle casts, 
the deep duplicate was the first sample analyzed. Samples were run surface to 
bottom. Just after running the sample from the mid-depth Niskin, the duplicate 
of the surface bottle was run. After the deepest sample was run, the duplicate 
of the mid-depth Niskin was run. 

Preliminary data indicate that the samples are approximately 2 units higher than 
the certified alkalinity value for Batch 86. After rejecting 6 of 166 CRM runs, 
the standard deviation was about 1 umole/kg-sol. The duplicates typically agreed 
within 0 to 2 umoles/kg of each other, with most of the duplicates within 1 
umole/kg of the first run. 

A total of 2758 samples were analyzed plus 265 duplicates. This does not include 
the 95 samples run during the underway program.

Trace metal hydrographic casts I6S
(Chris Measures, Univ. of Hawaii)

Hydrographic sampling for the trace elements Al and Fe was conducted during the 
CLIVAR I6S cruise aboard the R.V Revelle.  Samples were collected using a 
specially designed rosette system which consists of 12 x 12L Go-Flo bottles 
mounted on a powder-coated rosette frame.  The package was equipped with a 
SeaBird SBE 911 ctd that also had an SBE 43 oxygen sensor and a Wet Labs FL1 
flourometer.  The package was lowered using a Kevlar conducting cable and 
bottles were tripped at pre-determined depths from the ship using a deck box. 

The failure of the shipper to deliver the University of Hawaii winch to the 
Revelle before it sailed necessitated using a SeaMac winch that was already 
aboard the RV Revelle, that is normally used for streaming a magnetometer cable.  
After we had wound our cable onto this winch it became apparent that the winch 
was incapable of lifting our rosette package from the deck.  Chief Engineer Paul 
Mauricio then replaced a large part of the winch's hydraulics, with parts he had 
on hand and managed to improve the performance to the point where it could 
safely lift our rosette with 8 full bottles. Consequently we adapted our 
sampling strategy to obtain 8 bottles from a single cast in the upper 850m which 
kept us within the 1 hour ship time budgeted for the trace metal operation.  
After we had implemented this approach successfully at the first few stations we 
expanded our sampling to two 6-bottle casts at alternate stations.   This new 
sampling scheme was continued until station 43.  

During the upcast at station 43 the rosette system was lost when its Kevlar 
cable parted.  The loss occurred when an unusually large swell passed under the 
ship causing it first to sink in the water allowing the cable to the package to 
go slack.  This was followed immediately by a sharp and rapid rise of the ship 
on the following very large wave crest that jerked the cable taught breaking the 
cable at its connection point with the package

The loss of the rosette and the 8 GO-FLO bottles that were mounted on it 
necessitated a change in our sampling.  We attached one of our remaining 
Fiberglass encased 50 lb lead weights to the end of the Kevlar cable and 
attached a single GO-FLO bottle to the cable using wire clamps.   This bottle 
was then deployed into the mixed layer at each of the subsequent stations and 
was triggered using a plastic messenger.   After we had established the 
feasibility of this sampling approach we expanded our sampling to add a second 
bottle to the wire enabling us to obtain a 2 point profile.  At 3 stations where 
time permitted we made 4 2 bottle casts in the upper 400m. A total of 80 casts 
were obtained on 61 stations. Of these, 30 were with the rosette system, 50 with 
a Niskin bottle configuration.

While our sampling plan was limited by the winch issues and then the rosette 
loss, it was still possible to obtain surface mixed layer samples along the 
entire cruise track which is important for calculating oceanic dust input as 
well as Fe availability in the photic zone.  The additional 8 point profiles 
will allows us to delineate the effect of the Antarctic shelves in supplying Fe 
to the surrounding waters.

Dissolved Al and Fe were determined on surface water samples using shipboard FIA 
(C.I. Measures, University of Hawaii).  In addition, samples were collected for 
shore-based ICP MS determinations of dissolved and dissolvable Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, 
Cd, and Pb by isotope dilution (W.M. Landing, FSU).  Particulate samples were 
also collected for shore-based determination of trace elements by EDXRF (Joe 
Resing, NOAA/PMEL).



Aerosol Sampling
(Dr. William M. Landing, Kathleen Gosnell, Angela Milne, Florida State 
University)

Aeolian transport and deposition of soluble aerosol Fe is believed to influence 
phytoplankton primary productivity in the majority of the open ocean (far from 
Fe inputs from rivers and coastal sediments). The purpose of the FSU aerosol 
sampling program is primarily to measure the concentration of total aerosol Fe, 
and to quantify the aerosol Fe fractions that are soluble in natural surface 
seawater and in ultra-pure deionized water. Additional analyses are conducted on 
the samples in an effort to understand the atmospheric processes that yield 
differences in the aerosol Fe solubility. 

The aerosol sampling equipment consists of four replicate filter holders 
deployed on a 20' fold-down aerosol tower mounted on the forward, starboard 
corner of the 03 deck of the ship. One of the replicate filters (0.4 micrometer 
Nuclepore polycarbonate track-etched) is used for total aerosol measurements 
(see below); one replicate filter (0.45 micrometer polypropylene) is used to 
quantify the seawater-soluble fraction; one replicate filter (0.45 micrometer 
polypropylene) is used to quantify the ultra-pure deionized water soluble 
fraction; and one replicate filter (0.45 micrometer polypropylene) is used for 
precision (QA) tests or stored as a backup sample. Size-fractionated aerosols 
are also collected for 72 hour intervals starting every fourth day using a MOUDI 
cascade impactor (>3.2 micrometer, 1.0-3.2 micrometer, 0.56-1.0 micrometer, 
0.056-0.56 micrometer).

Air is pulled through the filters using two high-capacity vacuum pumps. The 
sampling is controlled by a Campbell Scientific CR10 datalogger that immediately 
shuts off the flow when the wind might blow stack exhaust forward towards the 
sampling tower, or when the wind drops below 0.5 m/s. Air flow is measured using 
Sierra mass-flow meters. 

We collected 24-hour integrated aerosol samples from February 5 through February 
8, then switched to 48-hour integrated sampling from February 8 through March 9 
due to the apparently very low aerosol loading we could see (visually) on the 
filters. The MOUDI cascade impactor was deployed five times (for 48 hours each 
time). Aerosol sampling was suspended on March 9 due to high winds and excessive 
sea-spray, which clogs the filters and yields nothing but sea-salt aerosols. 

One of the replicate filters from each sampling period was leached with freshly-
collected surface seawater (stored acidified). Another replicate filter was 
leached with ultrapure deionized water and stored frozen.

Analysis to be conducted on these filters and solubility extracts are: 

• Total aerosol Si, Al, Fe (to be analyzed using Energy Dispersive X-Ray 
  Fluorescence by Dr. Joe Resing at NOAA/PMEL). 
• Seawater-soluble aerosol Al and Fe (to be run back at FSU).
• Ultrapure water soluble Si, Al, Ti, Fe, chloride, sulfate, nitrate, sodium (to 
  be run back at FSU). 

The MOUDI size-fractionated aerosol filters are also leached with ultra-pure 
water for these same analytes.

Other Trace Metals Sampling

We collected archived samples from each trace metal cast for FSU shore-based 
analysis of dissolved Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb using isotope dilution 
ICPMS.

We (Gosnell and Milne) worked on developing a ship-board method for measuring 
dissolved Zn, with promising results. The detector we had available was not as 
sensitive as we had expected, so our detection limit was too high. We collected 
extra replicate samples from the each TM sampling; those will be analyzed at FSU 
when we have access to a more sensitive detector.

The Total Suspended Matter from each trace metal cast was collected on 47 mm 0.4 
um Nuclepore filters for EDXRF analysis of total particulate Si, Mn, Fe, and Al 
(Joe Resing, NOAA/PMEL). 

Rain sampling 

Rain was collected on 2 different days, with enough volume to filter an aliquot 
for comparison between total and dissolved trace elements on February 11.  The 
samples were filtered and frozen for analyses at FSU for soluble Si, Al, Ti, Fe, 
chloride, sulfate, nitrate, and sodium.

Isotopes of Silicon and C14

We took subsamples from our TM sampling and from the main rosette for Si 
isotopes (Ben Reynolds at ETH/Zurich). Over 600 discrete samples were collected 
for Si isotopes. Those samples will be shipped to ETH/Zurich from Cape Town.

We also collected over 390 subsamples for C-14 analysis from 18 profiles off the 
main rosette. Those samples will be shipped to WHOI.



CDOM and Optics
(Mary Russ, GSFC)

A free-fall profiler, designed to float away from the ship to avoid ship-induced 
perturbations to the in-water light field, was used for AOP data collection.  
The radiometric instrument that was used is a 19-channel Biospherical SuBOPS 
profiler.  This profiler is specifically designed to maximize the sampling 
resolution of the near-surface layer, while minimizing in-water radiometry 
problems, such as perturbations from shading, optical complexity resolution, 
near-surface effects, and bottom hazards.  

The SuBOPS profiler was tested, at the first test station during the I6S cruise, 
and weights adjusted to maximize a descent rate of ~ 50 cm s-1.  Temperature 
probes, attached to the instrument, provided knowledge of basic water column 
properties, like the depth of the mixed layer, and the presence of any distinct 
layers.  To verify the data were acquired during stable illumination conditions 
and to provide the appropriate normalizations of the data products (discussed 
below), a separate irradiance sensor was mounted as high on the ship's 
superstructure as possible (thereby preventing shadows or reflection 
perturbations) to measure the total solar irradiance, Ed (0+).  During I6S, two 
reference solar sensors were used, one capped, and mounted mid-ship, and 
uncapped daily during deployment of the profiler, and one on the bow, with other 
meteorological sensors, which remained uncapped throughout the cruise.  Signals 
from the profilers and the solar references were combined in a deck box, 
software time stamped, and stored as American Standard Code for Information 
Interchange (ASCII) tab-delimited (spreadsheet) files for final processing in 
the laboratory after the cruise (when the total chlorophyll a concentration has 
been determined at the sampling sites).

The SuBOPS profiler was deployed at 24 stations throughout the cruise and for a 
total of 66 casts.  Two to three casts per station were preformed, with 39 of 
the 66 casts (or 59% of the data) at the crucial 50°S or higher latitudes.  The 
maximum depths usually comprised one or two shallow casts (25 to 30 m) and one 
deeper cast to the 1% (75 to 110 m) or 10% (22 to 55 m) light levels. 

During the cast, the angle, pitch, and roll of the instrument were monitored.  
High quality data will deviate from zero by ±2°, with a deviation of ±4° 
producing acceptable quality data.  As illustrated in Fig. 3, most of the 66 
casts taken had absolute angles within ±4°, and the majority at or below ±2°, 
demonstrating a viable data set for final analysis.


Fig. 3:  SuBOPS stability in the water column during deployment, with stability 
         defined by absolute angle deviation from zero (see text for details).


For AOP measurements, the basic equations relating the up-welled radiance field 
below the sea surface with that exiting at the surface, the angular 
bidirectional dependency of these fields, and the transformation of radiance or 
irradiance values into reflectances are detailed in Morel and Gentili (1996), 
Mobley (1999), and Mueller (2000). An important note is that the formulations 
given in (1) and (2), assumes no artificial perturbations to the Lu and Ed (0+) 
measurements, and if present and unavoidable, correction schemes must be used.  
Artificial in-water perturbations for which corrections may be applied include 
instrument self-shading (Gordon and Ding, 1992) plus platform shading (Zibordi 
et al., 1999). The former is unavoidable, so a correction scheme will be applied 
during data processing, and the latter is rendered negligible by floating the 
profiler 30 to 50 m away from the ship prior to data collection. 

Overall, the in-water AOP processing scheme used for the data analysis follows a 
well-established methodology (Smith and Baker, 1984) that has been evaluated in 
an international round robin (Hooker et al., 2001) and shown to be capable of 
agreement at the 1% level. Routine agreement between data products derived from 
simultaneous deployments of similar instruments is to within the calibration 
uncertainty, about 2-3% (Hooker and Maritorena, 2000).  The Rrs values 
calculated from AOP data will be used in the in-water radiometry computations 
and satellite algorithms to quantify chlorophyll a concentrations, which will be 
validated using in situ pigment data.

Several biogeochemical samples were also collected during the I6S cruise.  After 
each AOP deployment, 20 to 25 L of water was collected from the ship's flow 
through system, and filtered, at low vacuum (~ 5 in Hg), through 25 mm GF/F 
filters for later in laboratory analyses of pigments (HPLC analysis), 
particulate absorption, and particulate organic carbon and nitrogen.  Water was 
also filtered through Poretics 0.4µm polycarbonate filters for future analysis 
of total suspended matter.  Further, water was collected from rosette water 
casts for several biogeochemical samples for Norm Nelson and Craig Carlson, at 
the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB).  At over 30 stations, 60 mL 
of water was collected at 6 to 24 depths, for analysis of colored (or 
chromophoric) dissolved organic matter.  Sub-samples (~ 2 mL) of this 60 mL of 
water were transferred into cryovials and fixed with formaldehyde, for later 
flow cytometry analysis.  At approximately 40, 50, 60, and 68 (S, 45 mL of water 
was collected, from the rosette at the top 12 depths, for special CDOM 
characterization, and at approximately 40, 50, and 68 (S large volume (~ 2 L) of 
water was collected at ~ 25, 500, and 1000 m and filtered for future CDOM 
experiments that will be designed at UCSB.

Surface sampling I6S, during March 2008
(George Anderson, SIO, coordinator of the underway sampling program)

After our last CTD station, a surface sampling program was carried out from 65.3 
deg S, 29.9 deg E to 41.3 deg S, 20.3 deg E. (March 8: 10:00 GMT through March 
14: 04:00 GMT).  Surface samples were collected from the ship's uncontamined sea 
water line.  Initially samples were collected every two hours, increasing in 
frequency to every hour at 50.8 deg S.  95 samples were collected.

In addition to recording readings from the ship's underway system, water samples 
were collected for salinity, oxygen, nutrients, dissolved inorganic carbon 
(D.I.C.), and alkalinity.  Water from the same system, but at a different 
location on the ship, was continuously sampled and pH measurements were made 
every 15 and later every 30 minutes.  

Salinity, nutrients and the oxygen samples were run by personnel from ODF, 
typically once per day.  D.I.C. and alkalinity samples were run by the groups 
doing these analyzes during the cruise, also once per day.    

Since salinity and oxygen are included in the ship's underway system, 
comparisons could be made between these values and those from the analytical 
analyses.  

The salinity difference (bottle value less display value) averaged -0.02 +/- 
0.01 units (91 of 95 values), but did appear to shift slightly from -0.017 at 
the southern part of the track to -0.025 at the northern end of the track.

Oxygen (bottle value less display value) showed an offset of approximately 0.45 
ml/l in the cold southern waters.  In the warmer salin waters near the northern 
end of the track, the offset appeared to be approximately +0.12 ml/l changing to 
-0.17 mls/l at the very end of the track.  Rob suggested that the differences in 
the offset may be the result of sensor calibration.  He believes that SeaBird 
calibrates its oxygen sensor at just one point, which would probably not be at 
zero degrees C.  A note will be sent to SeaBird with these data.  

During rough weather when the ship's bow came out of the water, air would be 
sucked into the underway seawater pump.  Even with relatively slow flow rates in 
the tubing used to draw the samples, small bubbles were readily apparent in the 
samples.  This fact was confirmed by higher than expected oxygen values. The 
data for D.I.C. have yet to be reviewed to see if the same problem exists with 
these data.

Occasionally errors could be found in the recorded data, e.g., incorrect oxygen 
flask numbers, a salinity value being recorded instead of the oxygen value, and 
a salinity of 35 being recorded as 33.  Also, at the most, 3 times on one watch, 
oxygen flasks were found that had not been shaken the required second time.      

Thanks should be expressed to the technicians of ODF who performed the analyses 
required as well as the students and watch leaders who helped with the sample 
collection.  Special thanks to Susan who helped coordinate/oversee sampling 
during the day shift and Dan who set up the display from which data could be 
recorded and the spreadsheet for entering all display data and merging the 
bottle data after analyses. 

A thorough check of all recorded and analyzed data has yet to be completed.   



Dissolved Black Carbon
(Thorsten Dittmar , Florida State University)

Motivation: Organic products from biomass and fossil fuel combustion (black 
carbon) are abundant in the environment. Their importance in global element 
cycles is widely recognized, although basic information is still lacking. 
Estimates of black carbon production exceed accumulation and loss rates by far, 
and the existence of major unidentified black carbon pools or loss processes is 
likely. It has been suggested that a black carbon component in marine dissolved 
organic matter (DOM) may be one of the missing links. However, the available 
information on black carbon in marine DOM is extremely scarce and not sufficient 
to constrain robust global estimates. The only information on dissolved black 
carbon in the deep sea is from the remote Weddell Sea off Antarctica (Dittmar 
and Koch, 2006) where a significant proportion of DOM (>2.4%) was thermogenic. 
If this estimate is representative on a global basis, then the dissolved pool of 
thermogenic carbon in the ocean could be >17 Gt, which is similar to the 
sedimentary black carbon pool. This preliminary estimate indicates that DOM 
could be one of the largest pools of black carbon on earth. The turnover and 
dynamics of this potentially large reservoir are unknown. The main reason for 
the scarcity of information is the analytical difficulty to determine dissolved 
black carbon at the very low concentrations found in the deep sea. Recently, PI 
Dittmar and colleagues developed new analytical techniques (Koch and Dittmar, 
2006; Dittmar, 2008), and we now have the necessary tools in hand to routinely 
quantify black carbon in marine DOM and to unambiguously confirm its pyrogenic 
source. 

The objective of our participation on CLIVAR I6S is to establish first 
quantitative estimates for the inventory and turnover of dissolved black carbon 
for a major oceanic region. 

Sampling and onboard activities: 

Samples (4 l each) were taken along the I6S section at 1º intervals (every odd 
numbered cast) within the mixed layer and below the thermocline (2 samples per 
cast) from the main or trace metals cast. At 3º intervals the major water masses 
from surface to bottom were sampled from the main cast (8 samples per cast, 4 l 
each). Two casts, one north of the Antarctic front and one south of the front, 
were sampled more in detail at 27 depths each (2 l per sample). A total of 210 
samples (approximately 800 l) were taken. Samples were collected in amber glass 
jars and acidified with HCl to pH=2 immediately after sampling. Dissolved 
organic matter was isolated from the seawater following the solid phase 
extraction procedure described in Dittmar et al. (2008). The salt-free and 
concentrated samples (6 ml per sample) will be analyzed for black carbon in 
Dittmar's lab at Florida State University and at the High Magnetic Field 
Laboratory in Tallahassee. 

Land-based analysis: 

Two new molecular methods using high-performance liquid chromatography (Dittmar, 
2008) and ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry (Koch and Dittmar, 2006) will 
be used for this purpose. The combination of the two methods will yield 
quantitative (concentrations of black carbon) and important structural 
information. The identification of molecular structures in black carbon will 
provide clues on its origin, i.e. biomass combustion, fossil fuel combustion or 
geothermal processes. We plan to complete chemical analysis by August 2008. 
The extensive physical and chemical dataset collected during I6S will provide 
valuable background information for the interpretation of the black carbon data, 
in particular for the estimation of flux and turnover rates.

Subsampling for other groups: 

The sampling for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen 
(TN) was overseen for PI Craig Carlson (University of California, Santa Barbara) 
whose group was unable to participate on I6S. Samples (40 ml) were taken at 1º 
intervals (every odd numbered cast) from 24 depths each. Samples from the upper 
250 m were gravity-filtered through combusted Whatman GF/F filters directly from 
the Niskin bottles. All other samples were taken unfiltered. A total of 
approximately 1200 samples was taken. The samples were kept frozen (-5ºC) in 
polyethylene bottles and shipped frozen to PI Carlson for the analysis of DOC 
and TN.

Helium and Tritium 
(Brett Longworth, WHOI)

Samples for helium and tritium analysis were taken from every fourth station, 
and were generally both from the same stations and depths. One duplicate each 
for helium and tritium was collected at each station. 24 depths were sampled at 
all deep stations. At either end of the transect, the sampling plan was altered 
to best cover a selection of depths and spacings along the slope and shelf. In 
total, 530 helium and 542 tritium samples were taken at 28 stations.

Method

Water for helium analysis was taken in 90mL stainless steel cylinders using 
tygon and silicone tubing, and was taken after CFC sampling. Cylinders were 
flushed with about 10 volumes of sample water to rinse and remove air bubbles. 
Samples for tritium analysis were collected with no rinse in 1L glass bottles 
shipped clean and backfilled with argon. Dissolved gasses were extracted from 
samples within 24h of collection using a vacuum extraction line and stored in 
flame-sealed 25mL aluminosilicate ampoules. No major problems were encountered 
during sampling and extraction, and less than 10 samples were lost during 
processing. 


Oxygen Isotope O18 in H2O
(Kevin Speer, FSU)

Starting at 53S, O18 samples were taken for post-cruise analysis in the UK, at 
the BAS. All even casts from stations 52-76 were sampled, thence stations 88, 
90,91, 93, 94, 96, 98, 101, 103, 105. In total 343 samples taken (one bottle was 
chipped). The result should be a section with roughly 1 deg resolution, 
emphasizing the upper layers. Typical resolution was 20-100 m in the upper 500m, 
100-500m below that depth.




Student reports

Austin C. Todd, Florida State University

The opportunity to participate in the 2008 CLIVAR I6S Cruise has been one of the 
most worthwhile experiences I have had during my academic career.  I am 
extremely grateful for being able to have this opportunity.  Not only have I 
been able to see real "blue water oceanography" as dubbed by one the scientists 
onboard, but I have also been able to learn a great deal about different 
disciplines of oceanography and some of the basic goals of the CLIVAR 
initiative. The overall around-the-clock dedication toward science of all the 
members aboard the R/V Roger Revelle made for a productive atmosphere that 
inspired me to learn as much as I could about the different data we were 
receiving. Also, the interaction with students and scientists from other 
institutions taught me to think about the data in ways I was not entirely 
familiar with beforehand.

One of the other benefits that I have gained from this cruise is knowledge of 
the important physical and chemical impacts of the Southern Ocean on global 
ocean circulation and climate variability.  I had not previously studied the 
Southern Ocean other than in a basic physical oceanography course, and now feel 
like I have a better understanding of some of the basic processes in this part 
of the world ocean system.  I have also learned about some other basic physical 
and chemical principles from the brilliant people onboard.

As far as the Revelle and its crew, I cannot complain.  The ship's 
accommodations were great, the food was fantastic, and the people were very 
welcoming and friendly.  Many of the crewmembers, while they may not have much 
knowledge of the scientific importance of our section, were eager to learn about 
our work and assist us in any way possible to reach our scientific objectives.  
Several times, the captain sat in on our science meetings simply because he was 
interested in learning about our progress.  Most everyone met his or her duties 
with a smile and a great attitude.  I can only hope to have such a great 
experience again in the future. 

Continuing the Science
Collecting and gathering the data onboard allowed me to continually examine some 
of the major process occurring along our section.  The CTD operations student 
group was lucky enough to plan a whole underway sampling and XBT launching plan 
for the return trip.  I think this was actually one of the most beneficial 
exercises, as it really taught us to analyze all of the different data available 
in order to make important executive decisions as to when and where we were 
going to sample and launch XBTs.  Not only this, but it also gave me quite a bit 
of motivation to complete a further study of the data after the cruise.  I would 
love to be able to analyze the data that was my responsibility to gather, and 
make some conclusions about the fronts in our return section.  Myself, along 
with some of the other CTD operations students, have already began to make some 
preliminary analyses of this data in preparation of possibly completing a report 
on our section, analyzing both the main I6S line and the return section.

I6S is an observational program for carbon hydrographic and tracer measurements. 
It is a repeat of the WOCE I6 line. The investigation includes physical, 
chemical and biological environmental parameters measurement. The cruise 
departed from Durban, South Africa on Feb 4, 2008 and reached the southernmost 
station around latitude 69S; then ended at Cape Town, South Africa on Mar 17, 
2008.

Our journey began with the extremely strong current, Agulhas Current, near the 
continental break, whose speed can exceed 2 m/s. The Agulhas Current with high 
temperature seawater flows to west and return to east south of it as 
retroflection current. Then we crossed three major fronts. The STF has strong 
surface expression with large temperature and salinity and the SAF has more 
subsurface expression. The PF associates with strong jet flow about 0.5 m/s. 
After that, we entered the "ice region", where the water property strongly 
influenced by the ice seawater interaction. 

Our back trace was slightly west of the down trace. On the way back, we deployed 
XBT to get the section data and high resolution on the fronts. XBT measures 
upper 1000 m layer seawater temperature and is easy to deploy. We, CTD watch, 
worked together to finish this job.

There were other two groups doing casts on station too. Trace metal group did 
one or two casts every other station and Optics casts were deployed when the 
time were close to noon. Water sampling includes CFC, Oxygen, DOC, DIC, AKL, PH, 
Si isotope, Black Carbon. They are important water properties and some of them, 
such as CFC and Oxygen, are great traces to investigate the biochemical cycle in 
the ocean.

My job on cruise was CTD operation, water sampling and XBT dropping. At the 
beginning, I learned how to operate the CTD console and how to deploy the CTD. I 
got lots of experience on this cruise. It is great to be able see the data in 
the front of me and helpful to understand the data. By pre-process the data, I 
learned how to connect the data to the knowledge I got from book. I also learned 
how to pre-process the ADCP data, which will be helpful for my research too. I 
gain good experience to organize a small project and to corporate with other 
people. I believe I can do better job for next time.


Jiyoung Paeng, Florida State University

I collected and processed water samples for black carbon analysis on I6S. Black 
carbon is an inert carbon compounds produced during biomass burning and fossil 
fuel combustion. The main goal of this cruise is to quantify dissolved black 
carbon in the Southern Ocean and to identify its source and transport in 
different water masses. For details on sampling, sample processing and land-
based analysis of black carbon refer to the respective section in the cruise 
report. 

The samples collected on I6S are a central part of my master's thesis at Florida 
State University, Department of Oceanography. The black carbon data from this 
cruise will be compared with data from the fire-impacted coastal zone in the 
Northern Gulf of Mexico. Anthropogenic impact is minimal in the Southern Ocean 
and provides therefore an important baseline for my research project.  

In addition, I took a class (FSU, OCE 5009L Marine Field Methods, 4 credit 
hours) that was thought onboard by Dr. Dittmar, with support form Drs. Speer, 
Landing and Measures. In this class we discussed the results form onboard 
analysis, in particular physical properties (fronts, currents, etc.) and water 
tracers (CFCs, nutrients, oxygen, etc.). As part of the class we also performed 
experiments with sea ice and extracted brine. My participation on this cruise 
provided me with a unique hands-on experience in oceanography. The class taught 
onboard kept me involved in the different research projects on the ship, and 
gave me the chance to experience science in a very different way than 
traditional class room teaching.


Kathleen Gosnell, Florida State University

During the CLIVAR 2008 I6S cruise I assisted in trace metal sampling. Trace 
metals are important components for biological systems, and iron has been shown 
to be a limiting nutrient for growth in some cases.  Trace metal sampling 
involves a special rosette system which is deployed with GoFlow bottles that 
contain no metal on the inside in order to reduce contaimination risk.  
Concentraions of the metals we analyze are so minute in sea water that it is 
important that "clean" sampling techniques are used when samples are taken. One 
of the tasks I participated in was to help subsample each bottle depth for 
nutrients and salinity in addition to our trace metal samples.  All of our 
samples are taken back to land where they are later analyzed in a clean lab.  In 
addition to sampling sea water depths, I also helped sample for aerosols and 
rain water in order to help determine sources of trace metals to the ocean.  
Aerosols samples are taken from an aerosol tower which we have set up high on 
the ship where there is less of a risk for seaspray or smokestack contamination.  
The aerosols are obtained with a vacuum pump which sucks air through filters in 
order to collect inorganic traces floating in the atmosphere.  Rain samples were 
obtained every time it rained, and we also attempted to get some snow samples on 
this leg.  However, there were not a lot of rain on this cruise, so we obtained 
only several samples.  For this cruise I was also attempting to learn and create 
a flow injection ship board method for measuring zinc. Currently there is not a 
lot of work being done on this element, and it is an important component for 
photosynthesis.  Therefore it would be useful to become sufficient with this 
method for future cruises.  Additionally I would like to create a thesis out of 
this technique as well.  My main purpose was to determine if the method I had 
chosen will work, and to try to work out some of the issues that would be 
involved with accurately measuring samples. Although I didn't get as far as 
measuring sample profiles for I6S, I feel that this method shows promise to use 
in future research cruises.

In additon to research work, I was also a student in the Marine Sampling 
Techniques class that was offered for this cruise, as well as taking another 
class (Biological Oceanography) which I will complete when I return.  I believe 
this class provided a good overview to what these cruises are sampling and 
working towards, since we talked about what other scientests and students were 
doing.  So overall it was a positive experience since I felt as if I was more 
aware of the work and research that was going on around me rather than just the 
trace metal bubble.


Juliana D'Andrilli, Florida State University

Since this was my first experience on a research vessel, I had no
idea what to expect, so I kept all my assumptions to a minimum and took 
everything in stride.  This was a smart line of thinking because from the very 
start of the trip, Esa Peltola and I were hit with bizarre obstacles, one right 
after the other.  

After all the unpacking and organizing was finished, I was finally able to start 
my training for taking samples and learning how to use the Dissolved Inorganic 
Carbon instrumentation.  This training session was crammed into about three 
hours, which initially made me nervous.  Esa continued to calm my nerves by 
assuring me that everything would be learned easily through repetition.  He was 
right.  Everyday at midnight, my day would begin and cycle through the same line 
of work, day in and day out.  I was lucky enough to work with a brilliant group 
of scientists and crew members, also working the night shift, who made the 
seemingly mundane process of sampling turn into one of the many highlights of my 
work day.  We shared laughs, stories, and songs all around the rosette and 
bundled up together when the temperature was below zero.  Our bunch became a 
sampling family, and I looked forward to it everyday.

Away from the rosette, I spent the rest of my work day running samples, working 
on my dissertation research for Florida State University, and watching the most 
beautiful sunrises.  Every day that I went to work began a new adventure.  There 
was always work to do, samples to run, stars and planets to gaze at, sea life to 
photograph, and shipmates to share experiences with.  It has been an 
unforgettable journey.


Katy Hill

The cruise has been a great experience. I was a member of the midday to midnight 
CTD watch, and also responsible for Argo float preparation and deployment. As a 
member of the CTD watch, I was involved in running the console for CTD 
deployments, and/or working on deck helping to deploy/retrieve. This was 
probably my favourite part, as it got pretty interesting in rough weather! Some 
shifts, especially on the shelf edge, felt like a bit of a marathon - as 
stations were close together, we had to redeploy the rosette as soon as sampling 
had finished!

We had a number of issues with the instruments on the rosette, which gave me the 
opportunity to learn about how it all works. We also had a couple of amazing 
days in calm weather close to the ice - an experience I won't forget in a hurry!

                   CLIVAR I06S:  Bottle Quality Comments



Comments from the Sample Logs and the results of STS/ODF's investigations
are included in this report.  Units stated in these comments are degrees
Celsius for temperature, Unless otherwise noted, milliliters per liter for
oxygen and micromoles per liter for Silicate, Nitrate, Nitrite, and
Phosphate.  The sample number is the cast number times 100 plus the bottle
number.  Investigation of data may include comparison of bottle salinity
and oxygen data with CTD data, review of data plots of the station profile
and adjoining stations, and re-reading of charts (i.e. nutrients).

          CLIVAR - I06S-2008 PRELIMINARY CTD + Bottle data
          
          Preliminary CTD and Bottle data are available in several formats:
          WHP-Exchange format (_hy1.csv/_ct1.csv)
          WHP90.1 format (i06s.sum/i06s.sea/*.ctd)
          and WHP NetCDF format (CTD only, *.nc).
          Descriptions of formats and parameter names can be found at
          http://cchdo.ucsd.edu/format.htm
          Full ODF documentation will be available when final processed data are 
          released.

          Since Oct. 2008, a few problems in the stored GPS navigation 
          (position) data were resolved, resulting in updated position data for 
          stations 5-7, 75 and 93. Quality codes for despiked (code 7) and 
          interpolated (code 6) CTD levels have been applied, but quality code 3 
          or 4 supersedes either of these codes in the CTD data files.

          CTD data T and C/O2 have been corrected to SBE35RT and bottle data 
          (respectively), grouped by sensor serial numbers; no casts have been 
          adjusted individually. T/S and T/O2 overlay plots will be used to 
          fine-tune corrections, then final Pressure/Property plots will be 
          examined to insure any remaining problems with individual casts are 
          investigated, documented and/or quality-coded.

          There is a 0.002 mS/cm difference between pre- to post-cruise Sea-Bird 
          Conductivity calibration results and shipboard salinity values 
          (shipboard values are lower). Discussions with SeaBird are continuing, 
          and comparisons of two different IAPSO SSW standard batches are 
          pending. The issue will be addressed and documented before data are 
          finalized.

          There are major problems with noisy CTD data (signal transmission, 
          sensor and/or pump problems, to name a few) on stations 2/1, 3/2, 6-
          18, late 60s through 80, 84, 102 and 103 (perhaps others). Secondary 
          T/C sensors were used where it was possible to improve the quality of 
          the CTD data by using them. Broad despiking filters were applied to 
          these noisy casts, and attempts were made to do preliminary coding of 
          bigger CTD data problems. No special fitting of T/C/O2 to 
          SBE35RT/bottle data for these casts with major noise/pump problems was 
          attempted, but rather they were substantially coded questionable.

          The files named "i06s*.zip" were created with the Linux zip (v2.31) 
          utility for the benefit of PC users. The data can be expanded into the 
          directory "./I06S-2008" using "unzip" or "pkunzip" utilities. Note 
          that pkunzip 2.04g or unzip 5.0p1 (or later versions) must be used to 
          extract files produced by pkzip 2.04 or zip 2.3. Earlier versions are 
          not compatible.

          I've placed the sum file, exchange bottle, and exchange ctd files up on 
          cchdo.These data are marked as preliminary.

11/14/08  Dickson        ALKALI         Submitted: FINAL DATA 
          THESE DATA HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE CCHDO AND ARE SCHEDULED TO BE 
          MERGED INTO THE ONLINE BOTTLE DATA FILES SOON. THE ALKALINITY DATA IN 
          THE BOTTLE FILES ARE STILL PRELIMINARY AT THIS TIME.

          This submission is a correction to the documentation file. This 
          paragraph should replace the Calibration paragraph in the CFC section 
          of the documentation.

          I am submitting the final CFCs for I06S 2008. In addition, I will 
          submit a correction to the documentation.

03/06/09  Johnson, Mary  CTD/BTL/SUM    Submitted: Revised data
          Nov. 2008 - Mar. 2009 revisions: a few quality codes were corrected 
          for CTD data, fluorometer quality codes 5 or 9 were added for a 
          malfunctioning or absent fluorometer on stas 22-32. "Uncalibrated 
          data" code 1 was added for fluorometer, transmissometer, PAR and SPAR 
          for stations 72-77 and 84, where those codes were missing; they were 
          already coded as such for all other casts. The CTD calibrations were 
          updated for stations 81-106; the changes should only cause minor 
          changes to the reported CTD data.

          A few more bottle data issues were also found and resolved; most were 
          conflicts between Sample Log notations and samples uploaded into the 
          ODF database for a few analyses. 

03/09/09  Fields         CTD/BTL/SUM    Website Updated: M. Johnson's new files online
          Mary sent updated ctd, bottle, and sum files on March 6th, I put them

04/30/09  Fields         CDOM/CFCs      Website Updated: data online
          I noticed that the bottle files for I06s have CFC-113 instead of 
          CFC113. I changed CFC-113 to CFC113.

          I06S_2008_CFCs.csv from Debra Willey
          In this file data from station 64 was listed form cast 1.
          According to the sum file there was only a rosette cast 2, no 1.
          I changed all of the cast values to 2 for station 64.
          Station 91 has cast 2. There were 17 casts for this station, with
          cast 17 looking like the one that actually collected bottle data. I
          changed all cast values for station 91 to 17.
          Station 92 has multiple cast values. The sum file lists only
          cast 3. I changed all station 92 cast values to 3. This seems
          like the most questionable change, as Debra Willey had casts
          1,2, and 3 listed for station 92.
          Station 1 had cast 1. I changed this to cast 2.
          In summary, I made the following cast changes:
          Station 1 1 => 2
          Station 52 1 => 2
          Station 64 1 => 2
          Station 91 2 => 17
          Station 92 1 => 3, 2 => 3
          
          After making these changes I was able to merge the following columns:
          CFC-11,CFC-11_FLAG_W,CFC-12,CFC-12_FLAG_W,CFC113,CFC113_FLAG_W
          
          ucsb_cdom_i6s_s7a_20090130.txt CDOM data from Norman Nelson at UCSB
          • I first ran this translate command on the file: tr '\r' '\n'
          • Changed data from tab delimited to csv.
          • Translated CDOM names and quality flags to match our parameter list.
          • The parameter CDOM was already in the bottle files, with units of
            325_1/M. I removed the CDOM column since CDOM325 was included with
            the new merge file.
          The following parameters were merged:
          CDOM325,CDOM325_FLAG_W,CDOM340,CDOM340_FLAG_W,CDOM380,CDOM380_FLAG_W,
          CDOM412,CDOM412_FLAG_W,CDOM443,CDOM_443_FLAG_W,CDOM490,CDOM490_FLAG_W,
          CDOM555,CDOM555_FLAG_W,CDOMSL,CDOMSL_FLAG_W,CDOMSN,CDOMSN_FLAG_W
          
          I created a new woce bottle file from this exchange file. Two
          columns from the old woce bottle file are missing in the new
          one that was generated from the exchange bottle file: CTDRAW and
          THETA. I have not created a new netcdf archive for these data.

05/07/09  Nahavandi      CTD/BTL/SUM    Submitted: revised data & documentation
          >> Posted May 6, 2009 (M.C.Johnson/P.Nahavandi)
          
          CLIVAR - I06S-2008 FINAL CTD + Bottle data and Documentation
          
          Final CTD and Bottle data are available in several formats:
          WHP-Exchange format (_hy1.csv/_ct1.csv)
          WHP90.1 format (i06s.sum/i06s.sea/*.ctd)
          and WHP NetCDF format (CTD only, *.nc).
          
          Descriptions of formats and parameter names can be found at
          http://cchdo.ucsd.edu/format.htm
          
          Full ODF documentation is now available.
          
          ------------------

          May 2009 revisions: a few more quality code errors were found and
          corrected for CTD and bottle data. Both bottle files have been
          regenerated and include the coding changes; the .sum file was
          re-created but has not changed.
          
          Data files for CTD stations 9/2, 10/1, 101/2 and 102/1 have been
          rewritten to update quality coding. CTD station 14/2 is still
          reported using primary TC data (01402 standard file prefix), but
          secondary TC data is somewhat better at deeper pressures. The
          secondary TC data are now also reported in separate files
          (01402-2 file prefix), so end-users can pick and choose the data
          set with the least noise for the area of greatest interest.
          
          ODF documentation has been finalized and is included with the data.
          
          ------------------
          
          Nov. 2008 - Mar. 2009 revisions: a few quality codes were corrected
          for CTD data, fluorometer quality codes 5 or 9 were added for a
          malfunctioning or absent fluorometer on stas 22-32. "Uncalibrated
          data" code 1 was added for fluorometer, transmissometer, PAR and SPAR
          for stations 72-77 and 84, where those codes were missing; they were
          already coded as such for all other casts. The CTD calibrations were
          updated for stations 81-106; the changes should only cause minor
          changes to the reported CTD data.
          
          A few more bottle data issues were also found and resolved; most were
          conflicts between Sample Log notations and samples uploaded into the
          database for a few analyses. The parameter lists for each cast in
          the .sum file may differ as a result of some of these changes.

          ------------------
          
          Oct. 2008 - Nov. 2008 revisions: a few problems in the stored GPS
          navigation (position) data were resolved, resulting in updated
          positions for stations 5-7, 75 and 93. Quality codes for despiked
          (code 7) and interpolated (code 6) CTD levels have been applied,
          but quality code 3 or 4 supersedes either of these codes in the
          CTD data files.
          
          ------------------
          
          There are major problems with noisy CTD data (signal transmission,
          sensor and/or pump problems, to name a few), particularly on
          stations 2/1, 3/2, 6-18, late 60s through 80, 84, 102 and 103.
          Secondary T/C sensors were used where it was possible to improve the
          quality of the CTD data by using them. Broad despiking filters were
          applied to these noisy casts, and attempts were made to do preliminary
          coding of bigger CTD data problems. No special fitting of T/C/O2 to
          SBE35RT/bottle data for these casts with major noise/pump problems
          was attempted, but rather they were substantially coded questionable.
          Details are provided in the accompanying documentation.
          
          Only the most basic processing (block-averaging) was performed on the
          Trace Metal CTD data; 2007 SBE calibration information was provided
          by U. of Hawaii and applied to Pressure, Temperature and Conductivity
          (Salinity). No corrections were applied to Fluorometer data, and very
          basic oxygen fits using nearby casts' oxygen data were applied to TM
          Oxygen data in order to get them in the ballpark.
          
          The files named "i06s*.zip" were created with the Linux zip (v2.31)
          utility for the benefit of PC users. The data can be expanded into
          the directory "./I06S-2008" (or ./I06S-TM-2008 for TM casts) using
          "unzip" or "pkunzip" utilities. Note that pkunzip 2.04g or unzip 5.0p1
          (or later versions) must be used to extract files produced by pkzip
          2.04 or zip 2.3. Earlier versions are not compatible.
