        abstract = {Here we report the completion of a uniformly calibrated open ocean data product on inorganic carbon and carbon-relevant variables that we call Global Ocean Data Analysis Project version 2 or simply GLODAPv2. The product includes data from approximately one million individual seawater samples collected from over 700 cruises during the years 1972-2013. Extensive quality control and subsequent calibration were carried out for salinity, oxygen, nutrient, carbon dioxide, total alkalinity, pH and chlorofluorocarbon data. Following calibration, the data were used to produce global climatology maps for many of the parameters. In addition to the data products and the mapped distributions, all of the original data files without alteration other than formatting and unification of units are made freely available along with whatever metadata was collected. An on-line cruise summary table provides data access and additional information including references to publications that have used data from specific cruises.

The GLODAPv2 database is available free of charge as a numeric data package (NDP-93) from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) at http://cdiac.ornl.gov/oceans/GLODAPv2/. The NDP-93 consists of the original cruise data files, adjusted data products, mapped data product and this documentation, which describes the GLODAPv2 project.}
