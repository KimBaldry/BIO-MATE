abstract = {During the European Iron Fertilisation Experiment (EIFEX), performed in the Southern Ocean, we investigated the reactions of different phytoplankton size classes to iron fertilization, applying measurements of size fractionated pigments, particulate organic matter, microscopy, and flow cytometry. Chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations at 20-m depth increased more than fivefold following fertilization through day 26, while concentrations of particulate organic carbon (POC), nitrogen (PON), and phosphorus (POP) roughly doubled through day 29. Concentrations of Chl a and particulate organic matter decreased toward the end of the experiment, indicating the demise of the iron-induced phytoplankton bloom. Despite a decrease in total diatom biomass at the end of the experiment, biogenic particulate silicate (bPSi) concentrations increased steadily due to a relative increase of heavily silicified diatoms. Although diatoms >10 µm were the main beneficiaries of iron fertilization, the growth of small diatoms (2-8 mm) was also enhanced, leading to a shift from a haptophyte- to a diatom-dominated community in this size fraction. The total biomass had lower than Redfield C : N, N : P, and C : P ratios but did not show significant trends after iron fertilization. This concealed various alterations in the elemental composition of the different size fractions. The microplankton (>20 µm) showed decreasing C : N and increasing N : P and C : P ratios, possibly caused by increased N uptake and the consumption of cellular P pools. The nanoplankton (2-20 µm) showed almost constant C : N and decreasing N : P and C : P ratios. Our results suggest that the latter is caused by a shift in composition of taxonomic groups.},

Fluorometric optical configurations were optimized to produce maximum sensitivity to Chl a while maintaining desensitized responses from both Chl b and pheopigments. Under the most extreme Chl b:Chl a ratio likely to occur in nature (1 : 1 molar), the new method results in only a 10\% overestimate of the true Chl a value, while estimates from older acidification methods are 2.5-fold low. Under conditions of high pheopigment concentrations (pheo a: Chl a = 1 : 1 molar), the new method provides Chl a estimates that are equivalent to those determined from the acidification technique. The new simple method requires a single fluorescence determination and provides adequate sensitivity for small sample sizes (<200 ml) even in the most oligotrophic marine and freshwater environments.},

abstract = {Abstract Microalgae are capable of acclimating to dynamic light environments, as they have developed mechanisms to optimize light harvesting and photosynthetic electron transport. When absorption of light exceeds photosynthetic capacity, various physiological protective mechanisms prevent damage of the photosynthetic apparatus. Xanthophyll pigments provide one of the most important photoprotective mechanisms to dissipate the excess light energy and prevent photoinhibition. In this study, we coupled a mechanistic model for phytoplankton photoinhibition with the global biogeochemical model Regulated Ecosystem Model version 2. The assumption that photoinhibition is small in phytoplankton communities acclimated to ambient light allowed us to predict the photoprotective needs of phytoplankton. When comparing the predicted photoprotective needs to observations of pigment content determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, our results showed that photoprotective response seems to be mediated in most parts of the ocean by a variable ratio of xanthophyll pigments to chlorophyll. The variability in the ratio appeared to be mainly driven by changes in phytoplankton community composition. Exceptions appeared at high latitudes where other energy dissipating mechanisms seem to play a role in photoprotection and both taxonomic changes and physiological acclimation determine community pigment signature. Understanding the variability of community pigment signature is crucial for modeling the coupling of light absorption to carbon fixation in the ocean. Insights about how much of this variability is attributable to changes in community composition may allow us to improve the match between remotely sensed optical data and the underlying phytoplankton community.},

abstract = {The geographic distribution, stocks and vertical profiles of phytoplankton of the seasonal ice zone off east Antarctica were determined during the 2005–2006 austral summer during the Baseline Research on Oceanography, Krill and the Environment-West (BROKE-West) survey. CHEMTAX analysis of HPLC pigment samples, coupled with microscopy, permitted a detailed survey along seven transects covering an extensive area between 30°E and 80°E, from 62°S to the coast. Significant differences were found in the composition and stocks of populations separated by the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (SB), as well as a small influence of the Weddell Gyre in the western sector of the ‘zone south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current’ (SACCZ). Within the SACCZ, we identified a primary bloom under the ice, a secondary bloom near the ice edge, and an open-ocean deep population. The similarity of distribution patterns across all transects allowed us to generalise a hypothesized sequence for the season. The primary phytoplankton bloom, with stocks of Chl a up to 239mgm−2, occurred about 35 days before complete disappearance of the sea ice, and contained both cells from the water column and those released from melting ice. These blooms were composed of haptophytes (in particular, colonies and gametes of Phaeocystis antarctica), diatoms and cryptophytes (or the cryptophyte symbiont-containing ciliate Myrionecta rubrum). Aggregates released by melting ice quickly sank from the upper water column and Chl a stocks declined to 56–92mgm−2, but the bloom of diatoms and, to a lesser extent, cryptophytes continued until about 20 days after ice melt. The disappearance of sea ice coincided with a sharp increase in P. antarctica and grazing, as indicated by increasing phaeophytin a and phaeophorbide a. Chlorophyllide content suggests that the diatom bloom then senesced, probably due to iron exhaustion. Stocks rapidly declined, apparently due to grazing krill that moved southward following the retreating sea ice. We suggest that grazing of the bloom and export of faecal pellets stripped the upper water column of iron (as suggested by low Fv/Fm ratios and CHEMTAX pigment ratios in Haptophytes – iron was not measured). Thus, export of iron by grazing, and possibly sedimentation, created a southward migrating iron gradient, limiting growth in the upper water column. North of the postulated iron gradient, a nanoflagellate community developed at depth, with Chl a stocks from 36–49mgm−2. This community was probably based on regenerated production, sustained by residual and/or upwelling iron, as indicated by a close correspondence between distributions of Chl a and profiles of Fv/Fm. The community consisted of haptophytes (chiefly Phaeocystis gametes), dinoflagellates, prasinophytes, cryptophytes, and some small diatoms. Selective grazing by krill may have fashioned and maintained the community. North of the SB, Chl a ranged from 40–67mgm−2 and was found predominantly in the mixed layer, but Fv/Fm ratios remained low, suggesting the community of P. antarctica and diatoms was iron-limited. These interpretations provide a cogent explanation for the composition and structure of late summer microbial populations in the marginal ice zone.}

abstract = {The Ross Sea continental shelf is dominated by the seasonal appearance of a large phytoplankton bloom. This bloom is regularly dominated by diatoms and the haptophyte Phaeocystis antarctica, and significant nutrient (nitrogen and silicon) reductions within the water column occur during the growing season (early November to late February). Diatoms mediate silicic acid removal, whereas both taxa remove nitrate. Dissolved and particulate nitrogen and silica concentrations were collected from a series of cruises to the southern Ross Sea over 3 years. Simple, one-dimensional nutrient budgets were generated for nitrogen and silica, and estimates of vertical flux were derived from these budgets. Substantial variations among years are observed to occur in seasonal community production, assemblage composition, Si:N uptake ratios, and export, and standard deviations are equal to ∼30% of the mean. During 2003–2004 a large Phaeocystis antarctica bloom occurred in December, and was followed by a bloom of diatoms. This secondary bloom was equal in magnitude to that of the initial P. antarctica bloom. In contrast, no secondary bloom was observed in 2001–2002. Continuous fluorescence measurements suggested that the spatial–temporal mosaic of phytoplankton dynamics in the Ross Sea is far more complex than previously thought. We hypothesize that variations occur between years not only in terms of both magnitude and composition of the bloom, but also in the controlling mechanisms.}

 abstract = {Chlorophyll and phaeopigment determinations on fresh water and marine samples of phytoplankton have shown that the following considerations are important in routine pigment analyses. (a) Methanol should be used as extraction solvent instead of acetone due to better extraction efficiency, shorter extraction time, and elimination of the need to boil or homogenize the samples. (b) For spectrophotometric determinations of phaeopigments, the methanol extracts should be acidified with HCl to a final concentration of 3× 10-3 M.
